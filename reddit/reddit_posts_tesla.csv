Tesla,"Former Tesla owners of Reddit, what went wrong with your Tesla?",1876,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1cx5l0k/former_tesla_owners_of_reddit_what_went_wrong/,2024-05-21 20:29:00,"['Bought a 2017 90D Tesla Model S for 53k in 2020 directly from Tesla. Bought it right at the start of COVID  Paid about $2,000 to upgrade the center screen, made a huge difference  Had lots of little things act up the car. The door handles constantly broke, where you press them to come out. They would stop responding to the press. Or the puddle lights would die out  Replaced the headlights a couple times. I’d get the “Tesla Pink Eye”, where the LED strip would burn out, making the headlight have a pinkish discoloration color  The seats always sounded like they were grinding plastic when going forward or backwards, it was really loud and obnoxious. They never could fix it  AC would shut off during super hot days, Tesla said it was diverted to “cool the battery”. The cabin would hit 100+ degrees during hot days here in Tampa   My biggest issue with my Tesla was that every year I owned it, it got slower  Every year I owned it, it lost range  Every year I owned it, it took significantly longer to charge  And the battery costs more than 20k to replace  Interior was awful. Even my Hyundai Santa Cruz has 10x the interior luxury of my Tesla Model S.', 'Early adopter here. On a ‘13 MS P85: HV battery replacement, drive unit unit replacement, no less than 16 tires replaced over the lifespan of the vehicle (21” turbine wheels). Everything except the tires was covered under warranty, so not a big deal.  Honestly, the worst part was dealing with the service center post-2018. They are overworked and understaffed since the Model 3 was released. No loaner cars, weeks to months long scheduling lead times, and poor quality repairs are what turned me off to the brand.', ""I had a 2018 Model 3 LR AWD that was built in December 2018.  I bought it new in March 2019 for a huge discount as it had been sitting in inventory for a few months after that first original tax credit halved on 12/31/18, and they couldnt sell jackshit in Jan/Feb of 2019 until they made some price cuts.  Anyways, I owned it for nearly 4 years and the only problem it ever had was the turn signal stalk stopped working and needed replaced.  Came to my office and did it while I worked.  Best service experience I'd ever experienced up to that point.  I stupidly decided I needed something bigger and traded it for a 2023 Model Y last year.  I've had NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS with the 2023 Model Y since the first week I got it home.  Its the biggest piece of shit car I've ever owned and Tesla's service experience has compounded their crapshoot quality control.   I've found that its all just a gamble as to the build quality of any new Tesla that you buy."", 'Own a 2019 model 3. At the time it was the best EV available (in Australia) for the money. Super fun to drive and very cheap to run.   Tesla could have continued to be leaders, but instead have focused on hype and pushing ""full self driving"" which has never come anywhere close to being useful in a practical sense (very glad I haven\'t paid for it). Autopilot is fine for highway miles, but most of my driving is within the city so I hardly ever use it.  Several things I dislike about my car:  - Touch screen controls for climate, window wipers, etc. No tactile feedback so often requires a glance away from the road or a few miss-clicks with my fingers wobbling around with car movement. Horrible.  - The automatic window wipers really suck, so I\'m stuck using manual control (see point above).  - Software updates which change the layout of controls. Its a 5 year old car at this point, and I don\'t care enough about it to get excited with new software features... I just want to have the driving experience I\'m familiar with every time I get behind the wheel.     Next car when I eventually replace it is unlikely to be a Tesla as these days there are better options.', ""I have tesla solar and in my first month it broke down.   I've had it for 3 years and the inverter has been replaced twice.  Every time they set the appointment for 2+ months out from the date it's been detected and it takes two appointments because they never have the parts the first time, so it's actually more like 3 months.   I've had an open ticket with them for 1.5 years which I recently reopened after I found out they closed it without ever resolving after asking me for tons of info.  For some reason the time of use with the power walls works every day except Friday afternoons, which due to my electric company causes severely high fees because I'm using grid power instead of my 100% full power walls.   After reopening the ticket two months ago, I still haven't heard back so I'll probably need to contact again."", 'Got my model3 in 2021.  The Car is good, wipers and headlight automatic are the worst ive ever seen.  Driving is superb tho.  But Tesla CX is god damn awful. Absolutely absurd how they are even still allowed to operate in Germany.  I got mine through my company (basically take the car or not, even if I dont take it, my paycheck wouldnt get bigger). Its pretty pretty pretty cheap, but I just hope that nothing breaks during my 4 year-term.  Would never flat out buy one tho.', 'Ridiculous service experience for a minor repair. Ignoring that the extremely necessary and common part took over a month to arrive at the sc, they refused to service vehicle on scheduled day and instead would only provide a 5 day window that the repair *may be completed within*, which fell over a weekend, which they notify you of only one day in advance of your appt. During this time, they provide Uber credits, but not nearly enough to not impact potentially 5 full days of life. Instead, I just wanted to wait at sc while repair is made- other companies do this repair within an hour or two. They wouldn’t discuss in app and deleted my questions. They agreed to reschedule for a time to make this possible when I arrived for my first appt. Upon arriving 2 months later for the second appt literally the same service tech had no memory of arrangement and became argumentative. After not backing down they were able to complete the repair within about an hour that day on the scheduled date.    I understand not all SC’s are like this, but there’s not an alternative in my area and I don’t intend on dealing with that sort of headache for anything major. Tesla can find another asshole. I traded for a Volvo C40 Recharge. There’s a few features I miss from Tesla, but there’s so much more piece of mind that it’s not even a consideration. I’ve owned many brands of vehicles but there’s only one I refuse to ever consider again.', ""A good friend of mine (well, at the time, we have, unfortunately grew distant) was a pretty early adopter of Tesla.  She had put her young kid in the car, and when she closed the back seat, and went to get into the driver's seat - the doors were locked.  The key fob, the app, nothing would unlock the car.  It was a hot day, and she was FREAKING out.  someone had to knock the window out on the passenger side front window so she could climb in and get her kid out.  She and her husband were able to return the car, and get out of their lease, as long as they signed an NDA to say they wouldn't talk to the news about it.  (for people responding, saying this is illegal, or made up - I can't tell you for sure.  She had moved across the country and we stayed in touch.  She texted me this story, and I had no reason to think she lied about any of it.  But, this is not a hill I'm going to die on.  Call BS if you want, you might be right.  you might not be - what do I know?)"", ""Got rear-ended at a stoplight and sustained extremely minor damage to the rear left bumper.  Car refused to go into drive after the accident, ended up having to get it towed to the nearest authorized tesla repair shop where I was informed the damage, which would've been less than $500 to fix on any other car, was going to total it out.  Never buying one of those pieces of shit again."", 'Current owner (Model 3 performance) but doubtful I will stay with them once I have finished this term. They are just making it impossible for me personally to go to the models newer than 2020 age.  The needless ""re-inventing"" the wheel with every interaion is infuriating.  1. Windscreen auto wipers had been solved decades ago, but no not for Tesla, let\'s use AI vision that doesn\'t actually work. Perfectly dry and sunshine out? Have a random wipe or ten. Swear they are in cahoots with Bosch to wear down the wiper blades as fast as possible.  2. Parking sensors - again decades old tech that works. Nope, again AI vision which ""guesses"" if something has moved from in front or behind you since you last turned off the car.  3. The stalks - no one asked for no stalks. No one wants to be navigating the constant roundabouts of EU/UK (less of an issue I am sure in the USA) trying to find a button that moves as you turn the wheel to indicate your exit.  4. The worst of all though has to be the interuptions from what the car deems to be certain death and tries to steer when there is nothing at all there. If it\'s sunny on two particular stretches of road it happens every time, driving straight ahead, clear view of the road at 40MPH - Tesla starts beeping and tries to put me into someones driveway instead of the road! I have also had full on emergency braking on a dual carriageway at 70MPH because it deemed the truck in the layby to be in my lane - was VERY lucky no one was behind me!', 'Also current (2x) but unlikely to again. I have a 2020MX with roughly 135k miles.  It has had three battery replacements (under warranty) and an expensive uncovered electrical problem that was blamed on rodents without evidence (even though i asked for the old parts). The windsheild has broken almost every winter due to defrosting stresses (uncovered and expensive). There are design flaws in the suspension that eat up tires and CV joints. Front clip body garneshments are constantly popping off due to flex in the snow.   All that being true, the issue for me was less about the technical problems and more about customer service. Tesla’s nearest service center is nearly two hours away and they have not made any progress on openning anything nearer. Major repairs are slow. At one point as late as 75k miles, it had been in repair about 1/3 of its days since purchase. The service center experience is dirty and barebones. Many of the repeat repairs are clearly due to poor previous service and parts. Complaints fall on deaf ears if they fall in human ears at all.   I could, but wont rant for hours about FSD.  7/10 products  2/10 service  0/10 cares about customers', ""Not myself, by my uncle was an early Model S owner back in 2015 or so (way back when Tesla's were actually desirable, not the stigma-filled lumps they are today). He had a it few years but got so annoyed at all the OTA updates that progressively nerfed the car he got rid of it, went to Polestar and vowed never to get a Tesla again.  Getting into the car and finding that a feature you used yesterday has just been disabled for no reason can get pretty annoying."", '[removed]', 'After the software update that turned off the FSD trial on my 2018 Model 3 my autopilot and cruise control had a firmware mismatch that disabled the functions.   Took it to service and they fixed the firmware, but said I had a coolant leak and needed to replace some parts.   Got in the car a couple days later and the AC wasn’t working and reporting that the compressor isn’t working.  Was working completely fine before Tesla service messed with it.   Then the Tesla app said I couldn’t get another appt to fix the AC for two weeks… during summer, which effectively makes the car with a glass roof undriveable.   I will never own a software defined car again.   I canceled my Cybertruck reservation and put the $100 towards reserving a 2025 Ramcharger.', 'After a non-fault accident, it took months to get my Tesla repaired because of the unavailability of spare parts.', 'The rear seats were too cramped, making the car impractical as my family grew.', 'Current-but-never-again Tesla owner: My car is fine, but I really don’t like the driving experience of the newer units which I’ve had access to and the service has gone off a cliff the last few years.', '[removed]', 'I still own mine, because for some reason my wife likes it enough that she doesn\'t want to replace it.     I bought it 3+ years ago.  I\'ve had a bunch of service appointments.  Some minor, some less so.  Some nit picky stuff, like not having a garage door opener pre-installed on a nearly 60k car.  Not being able to have it installed prior to taking delivery of the car.  Some stuff like they damaged 2 of my wheels at service.  They took ownership of having damaged the first, and then for more than 4 months said that they ""didn\'t have any way to replace/repair the wheel"".  The second they outright denied.  I\'ve had the charging port ECU go bad, and the quickest service appointment wasn\'t for 6 weeks.  I was able to beg for a quicker appointment and they got me in quicker.  The process for service changes (usually you just drop it off, but now you need to talk to somebody) without notice.  The last time I dropped the vehicle off, their service software didn\'t work, so I had to go back and bring them a key.  The mobile visits for stuff like ""adjusting the windows that are so misaligned they leak, the spoiler coming off of the car, and the leather coming loose off of the steering wheel"" have been great.     Not having a spare tire sucks.  Not having a loaner sucks.  When they were issuing Uber credits you couldn\'t use them to tip your driver.  Being associated with King Baby Musk sucks.  The overall fit/finish on a car this price sucks.  It\'s broken.  A lot.  The constant shenanigans with pricing suck.  I got crucified for saying it, but I bought a M3P in 2021.  Up to that point Teslas had been holding their value fairly well, so it felt like a fairly safe way to try out owning an EV.  I was not eligible for the tax credit.  In the coming year or two, they managed to tank the prices of used models by continually bumping down their pricing and getting the tax credits back.  A car I paid 56k for was worth 38k as a private sale less than 18 months later when I had gotten frustrated with how often a brand new car was broken.  I\'ve had 4Runners and Tacomas and WRXs that I owned for less than 3 years that I was able to get most of my money back out of.  I wasn\'t willing to eat nearly 20k in depreciation in 18 months, so we kept and drive it.   It was in a fairly minor accident where the rear bumper and the passenger 1/4 panel were grazed.  It took a repair shop 3 months to get us in, and another 3 months to fix it because of parts availability from Tesla.  We live \\~30 minutes from a Tesla dealer, but I can not fathom how you own one if you don\'t have a dealer close.    The supercharger network is great.  We regularly take trips in the car, and while I always worry that something will break on a car with less than 25k miles on it, I never worry about running out of charge.  It is blisteringly fast for the price.  Auto drive is okay, but not something I remotely trust past ""glance down at my phone to change a song"".', 'Comically small branch fell on roof of our Model Y, cracked the glass panel that goes from windshield to roof and it was considered totaled.  Bought at pandemic low end prices and incident occurred near peak pricing. Used insurance money to buy a RAV4 Hybrid and pocketed the rest.', 'Tesla has an app that allows you to report issues and provide roadside assistance. sounds good and all, but you now what\'s really messed up about it? you can\'t directly write what\'s wrong. you have to choose from a dropdown menu potential things that are wrong with your car. this is really messed up for two reasons. One, it doesn\'t properly record the issue you had with your car so if you ever decide to file a lawsuit, tesla can turn around and say ""look, it wasn\'t that serious. they called roadside assistance for this small issue.""

Reason to sell it:  • Approaching 100000km  • Lack of service centers in home town (next service center is the capital, about 45min away). Long wait times for service appointment. Really missing the extremely tight service network of established car manufacturers, and the readily available „free“ (unaffiliated) service centers.  • Kind of connected to the point above: Detailed work instructions for „free“ service centers apparently not readily available.  • (For the price) a lackluster quality of work.  • “Autopilot”: Good feature that really is nice, but very error prone, to the extend that it spured investigations by several regulatory bodies.  • Biggest social problem: The very visible CEO that seems to have lost his marbels, and the Tesla fans that unabashedly idiolises him  • More a sad thought: Tesla squandered its lead in autonomous driving and “computerization” in the last years.  Now I’m back with an (electric) Mercedes.', 'Front motor swap on my brand new 2023 M3P due to a whistling issue.  Persisted after the swap, turned out to be a brake caliper…   My hood/frunk. was misaligned upon delivery and I was told to accept the vehicle and schedule a repair as it was minor (dumb move in hindsight, I know).  The service team attempted to return the vehicle to me with no fix to the misalignment two separate occasions; I was made out to be the asshole because I refused to accept it.  It eventually took them a month for them to repair.  I had to fight tooth and nail to get a loaner.    The Service personnel are rude, dismissive, and overall incompetent IMO.  The car is great now, but based on the service experience alone, I likely wouldn’t buy another Tesla.', ""I had a 21 model X.  - Suspension issues galore for a shitty bumpy ride, Front suspension replaced twice, still didn't fix the THUD every time I hit the gas.  - The falcon doors were constantly breaking and literally even hitting each other (How do you even design doors that can hit each other???) Had to drive home with it half closed alarm blaring multiple times.   - Infotainment issues non stop, constant reboots, freezes Sirius XM would just disappear sometimes.   - All those cool games and Tiktok apps etc, literally froze the entire system every time I opened it. Was told by tech, ya that happens, hopefully they'll fix it in an update (The update never came)   - Tachometer screen worked when it wanted to.   - Stereo worked when it wanted to, so many quiet drives even after a soft reset.   - 12V battery died within 3 months and had to be flat towed to the dealership leaving me stranded.   - Falcon doors almost killed my nephew because who needs working sensors on a 200lb door  - Front trunk was near impossible to close.    - Pops and rattles like a rock in a soda can.   - Loose panels, cracks OHH AND THE DOOR HANDLES THAT NEVER LINED UP  - Tires wore out after 15k miles. Because fuck designing suspension that doesn't tear up your tires.   - FSD? Literally drove though my neighbors yard on summon, tried steering me into oncoming traffic or sideswiping trucks multiple times. 12k and I never used it, it was so bad.   Wife would actually joke if my car was in the mood to work today and I can keep going, I'm sure I'm forgetting some of the fun stuff.   Now let's talk about the service dept. Be ready to FIGHT! Amenities? None. Customer Service? HA! Had to provide proof and argue my case with timestamped photographic proof like a murder defendant on trial.   Then when you could get in 6 weeks from Sunday, guess what you get? A loaner? If you fought hard enough, you'd maybe get a throttled chill mode model 3, (imagine people flying past your as you're capped out at 75mph on the freeway). Usually they'd just give Uber credits, which is awesome for picking up your kids /s. Also, tip not included.   Only thing I would add is at least it held it's value back then (Good luck now). Thank god I sold right before that bubble popped.  In case you're still reading this. Fuck Tesla. They are a budget brand Kia at a luxury brand price. (Actually that's an insult to Kia I take it back) Never again.  Most of the people that are commenting about how great they are are either Musk shills, Tesla PR, or lying to themselves. Get a Toyota/Lexus and don't suffer like I did."", ""It wasn't an issue so much with the car, thought the quality could have been better.  My issue was everyone around me thought it was some kind of political statement.  I have never had so much negative feedback from a car I owned as the Tesla.  Just got tired of it."", ""Not much, honestly. There were a few annoyances though. The automatic windshield wipers are a joke, clearly their engineers have never lived outside of California. The regenerative braking doesn't work consistently - if the battery can't take the charge (too full, too cold) you just coast instead of braking which is a surprise when you have to slam on the brakes on your morning commute.  Overall it was the nicest car I ever owned, but also the only nice car I've ever owned so I can't compare apples to apples. If I ever buy another car it will 100% be electric but I don't know if it will be a Tesla.  Also, Elon Musk is a human skid mark.

Thought I’d never consider switching back to gas up until this year. My reasons being:  1. This one isn’t specifically the car, but the lack of supercharger availability and more & more people moving to Florida. There is not a single supercharger in my town, so I have to drive to the turnpike (and pay a toll!) to charge my car. This drive used to take 7-15 min depending on traffic, now it takes 20-30 min. There are only 8 stalls available, sometimes I’d have to wait 5 min for an available charger if I came around lunchtime or during rush hour, but there were always plenty open if I went after the gym around 7-8pm. Now, I find myself waiting ~20 min for an available charger, no matter what time of the day. Between driving, wait time, and charging, it takes around 2 hours just to make sure my car is charged for the next three days!   2. Charging mileage does not go as far as it used to. I drive under 30 miles most days, which actually uses ~65 miles of battery. Charging costs have also gone way up.  3. My tires wear out so fast, I need to replace them once a year.  4.

I ordered at the beginning of the month, quoted 6 weeks for delivery, and was contacted a week later to offer me a significant discount if I would take delivery by June 31. I played hard to get and also got a year of free supercharging out of them.  A week after I picked up the car I hit a nasty pothole in New Jersey which chipped the front drivers side rim. Shit. I contacted customer service and lied, saying that I must have missed this chip during my delivery walk around. They were doing a huge push to get Q2 deliveries up so the stock would get a boost, and without hesitation agreed to replace for free.  Later that summer, I noticed water in the trunk. First service appointment, no loaner and they did not fix the issue. Second service appointment, the manager was very apologetic and said he would keep the car for an extra few days to make sure it would not need to come back. He also offered me a loaner that had just come in but was not yet software governed as a loaner, 2017 Model S P100D. He gave me a serious warning to be careful and to please not screw him over lol. I was biting my lip to avoid grinning but made it out of there with the key fob. I ended up having the car for 8 days and kept it until the last possible minute, I returned it at like 9:00 PM on a Sunday and was able to pick mine up at the same time. I chalk this very positive experience up to the manager (shoutout Bill!) rather than a company policy. He gave me updates every other day and had a hose spraying on the car for an exceptionally long time. They ended up replacing the rear trunk gasket and also finding a gap in some weld that was allowing the water ingress.  2022 the car started making a clicking/thunking noise when turning. Service appointment- told them where I thought the noise  was coming from and got an Uber voucher. They replaced both front control arms under warranty and I was told they were upgraded units due to it being a known issue of a too heavy car on control arms not meant for that weight , but I’ve never been able to independently verify there being an upgraded option from Tesla.  Some downsides to the car- No spare tire. I got stranded at night three hours from home with no ability to swap out a spare. $300+ Uber ride home because my kid had school the next day and the car was towed the next morning.  Very hot in summer because of the all glass roof, and the cabin temperature control only goes for 12 hours before shutting off. So days where I didn’t use the car the interior would get to 125+ degrees. Sunshade doesn’t help much but it’s something.  Random software issues, my phone key stopped working after an update and Tesla didn’t know how to help. I ended up figuring out a temporary fix after much frustration and the issue resolved after the following software update. Still annoying.  Autopilot is shitty with a lot of unnecessary braking, slow to get back up to cruise speed, like others have said it doesn’t know a parallel parked car or car on the shoulder of the road is not an imminent collision risk. I use it on long trips to reduce fatigue but I treat it like it’s going to kill me if I don’t pay attention.   The interior is very basic compared to other 50-60k cars. It’s not a huge deal because it’s the first truly new car I’ve ever had but still a massive area for improvement.  The stupid door handles freeze in winter and takes a well placed knuckle punch to free them up. It’s not as much of an issue for me but I have to do it to all the doors if anyone else is riding in the car.  It’s noisier than any comparable vehicle and it’s noticeable at highway speeds.

Like I cannot believe they could say this is out of beta, in fact it\'s barely good enough to be a beta at all. I only used it three or four times and in that time I noticed the following:  * Acceleration / braking / steering are a bit choppy sometimes. If you have passengers who tend to get carsick, FSD is not for them. It seems to try to follow the curb when turning instead of seeing where the lane is going. I have a weird shaped angle turn out of my neighborhood and every time I felt like it was about to hit the curb. It also seems to lack the ability to smoothly anticipate how other cars will slow down at a light, so instead of slowing evenly as a human would, it\'s like it\'s surprised that the car in front is braking. * A total inability to switch from navigate mode to ""find a parking space"" mode, if there even is one. When I drove it to a Costco, I had to deactivate it in the parking lot so I could park myself, but the only way to deactivate seems to be ""jerk the wheel as if something is horribly wrong"" and then it asks you to report the problem. If you let it keep navigating, it will just pull up to the front door. * The absolute worst issue I had, more than once in fewer than 5 uses, was that it gets confused on speed limits. I don\'t know if this is because it\'s relying on bad maps, misreading road signs, or both, but sometimes you\'ll be in a 45 and suddenly it thinks the limit dropped to 25 like on a side street, so suddenly you\'re slamming on the brakes in the middle of fast moving traffic. This happens on the highway too, and I think this is a case of it seeing the ""40 mph minimum"" signs and thinking that\'s the limit. So traffic is going 70, and suddenly the car wants to drop to 40 and you have to disengage so it doesn\'t cause a pileup crash. How in the hell is this considered good enough for public release? * EDIT: forgot one other mistake it made! On the highway, I was in the right lane, and saw a semi heading down the on-ramp. A human would see that and go ""oh I need to make room for this truck that will have a difficult time merging or changing speed"" but the Tesla is completely oblivious.

I see more DC fast charging stations around than Tesla fast charging stations.  So I decided to google it.  According to Google there are 6000 DC fast charging stations in the United States.  There are 1772 Tesla fast charging stations in North America.  So there are more DC fast charging stations.  Now, each Tesla charging station has on average 9 chargers.  And from my experience DC fast charging stations generally have 2 chargers.  So there might be more actual Tesla chargers, but they are in fewer locations making road trips to less populated areas more challenging.

EVs also don’t make sense for me financially given how much I drive (not a lot), and considering the opportunity cost from foregone investments (higher vehicle cost = less money for VTI). But I can also see where the market is going, EVs are an inevitability because they theoretically perfect the concept of the car as an appliance.

That being said, as someone who consulted for a Hydrogen car company for a bit there's a few reasons they haven't took off. The biggest is infrastructure. A hydrogen station is substantially harder and more expensive to build than an EV or gas station largely due to the fact that gaseous hydrogen is so small it can sublimate through most materials when under high pressures.

The final headwind is that hydrogen production relies on renewable energy to be green so you're gonna have to invest in electrical infrastructure anyway, so why not just save a bunch of money and just build EVs?

But you can't pull more power out of the cells, that they are capable of delivering. A cell will deliver for example 10C.

Short of piercing it with a bunch of nails, you're not gonna make it go boom. Can't speak for EV cells specificaly, but most if not all 18650 cells for example are designed in such a way, that even if you overcharge them (for example 12V on a 4.2V cell) they won't go boom.

Brake calipers may need lubing every other year or so, but I haven’t had to change brake pads in 10 years.  In terms of technology, Tesla is still the best deal. They’ve standardized on heat pumps for efficiency, and their batteries are still the standard for performance and durability. Right now, Teslas still set the standard for road trips. The Model Y and Model 3 are among the most energy efficient out there, I can get 4 miles per kWh pretty easily. However, they have a stiff ride, and they have spartan interiors. My 2021 has minimal wood trim, and it seems Tesla removed even that since. The other companies seem to be making their interiors more elaborate in order to differentiate themselves from Tesla.  Depreciation- If you plan on selling the car after 3 years, consider leasing an EV. Right now, though interest in EVs is high, most first time buyers are reluctant to buy a used battery. This combined with Hertz starting to flood the used market with used Teslas, combined with tax credits making new Teslas less expensive, these factors and others drive used car prices up and down and affect depreciation. I’ve seen my 2015 Volt depreciation yo-yo over the years. Buying a used car off of a lease may be the better choice if depreciation is a highest priority, but then you have to exercise due diligence with evaluating a used car and getting a good enough warranty. I’m guessing there are a lot of Chevy Bolts off lease right now. Not a road trip car, but I’ve heard it’s great with car seats. There are probably a bunch of previous generation Kias that have ended their lease, which would also seem to work well with child seats. Again, not as good at road trip charging speeds as a Tesla. Both also have relatively energy efficient motors, but still not as efficient as a Tesla with a heat pump. If you know for sure you’re going to sell the car after 3 years, consider a bargain basement used Nissan. The batteries don’t have liquid temperature control, so they degrade more with similar use. People are really reluctant to buy these used, and they depreciate like crazy, but that also means most of the depreciation has probably already happened. I wouldn’t keep this car for long though, or else the level of battery degradation could sink any value left in the car, so there’s some risk with a used Nissan.', ""None of them, it's a complete scam."", 'I bought my Toyota BZ4X used from CarMax for 38k with 6k miles on it.

He will not dictate what people can buy. The quote he made which is taken out of context is “they won’t be able to sell them (EV cars)”. The context is that they won’t be affordable because tax revenue (the people’s money) won’t be used to prop up a failing industry.

Beware, this sub tends towards anti-EV so don't take every comment (including mine) as gospel.  If you can charge it at home from a wall box and don't regularly travel more than 200-250 miles in one go, an EV will be great.

You will get between 3 and 5 miles per kWh of electricity so how much do you pay for a kWh of economy 7 electricity divided by 4 miles gives you a price of how little it will cost you to drive 1 mile. Note: petrol cars currently cost around 16p per mile.   You'll get around 240 miles from a full battery in the worse of winter, and around 300 miles in the best summer conditions, subject to how heavy right footed you are, if the car you are looking at is fitted with the 64kW battery.   Worth going for the top spec model too as, 2nd hand the price is about the same. There is a glut in the market and you may be able to negotiate on price.

The cars main faults are:  * Rear seat leg space - not great for rear seat adults on long journeys,  * Android auto /Apple car play only work with a cable plugged into a USB port.   but other than that this car is difficult to fault. Go for a model with heated and cooled front seats, great in extreme weathers.   The only obvious issue you might have is the 12v car battery may need replacing in 2 years and it might need some new front tyres soon as the originals didn't have the deepest treads.  Edit:  Looking at other posts here, it is worth pointing out that petrol cars will cost you more in fuel and repair bills, hybrid cars need more servicing so will cost just as much as a petrol one and you may find an alternative tariff that makes your home economy 7 cheaper than it is now, making the Kona even cheaper. Tax is currently zero, congestion charges zero, MOT costs the same price, insurance about the same as a petrol car too. Overall this sounds like an ideal car for your needs.   The battery has an 8-year warranty and is likely to last over 20 years. You can get the seller to prove how much battery  capacity is left, but it unlikely to be less than 98% of original capacity and given the age, may well be still 100%.  The car is,m able to set charge start and finish times from the infotainment screen or from the phone app, and battery maximum fill, to stop charging when the battery is 80% or 100% full as you require, so you can tell the car to only charge when you have cheap electricity and all you need to remember is to plug it in once or twice a week.

The only people that are being new EV's should be those on company car or salary sacrifice schemes, dont buy new with your personal money as depreciation will be too much to stomach.   If you want an EV there are 2 things to consider really.

Public charging is only going to get better but currently it is a poor experience, downloading multiple apps etc and the cost of close to £1.00pkwh 10 x price of charging at home is a joke and makes having to charge public regularly a miserable experience.  Really nice to drive an ev, just really simple,  being able to cool/heat from an app also great help, especially setting a timer every day so you dont have to defrost before work.  I have been waiting for 6months to get a second car, I do a 300 mile trip twice a month so if I wanted a full ev it would probably have to be a Tesla just due to the easier public charger situation as well as more reasonable public charge, rest of time I do short school run, so potentially a plug in hybrid will be what I go for.  I really don't like the look of a Tesla but I have test drove one and can see why a model 3 is so popular.

Hydrogen does have its own problems, some of which have already been solved (or are further along) for BEVs. Infrastructure is probably the biggest advantage of BEVs over hydrogen power, but even that might be overstated.  Lithium Ion batteries are so far off from matching diesel/petrol in specific energy (energy per unit mass) that incremental improvements to current tech have no hope of closing the gap. And the specific energy of hydrogen fuel is triple that of diesel/petrol.  * Current Li-ion batteries: 0.97 MJ/kg (270 watt-hours/kg) * Cutting Edge Lithium: 2.5 MJ/kg (created by researchers in a lab in 2023, not production ready) * Diesel/Petrol: 45 MJ/kg (18x the energy density of cutting edge, 45x current tech) * Hydrogen: 120 MJ/kg (48x cutting edge, 120x current tech)  Current density represents an increase of roughly 0.6 MJ/kg over 10 years ago (density has tripled). If we assume it continues to triple every 1 years, then it would take until the late 2050s to match diesel/petrol. This is not realistic, however, as the theoretical maximum of Li-S batteries at 400v (Tesla battery voltage) is 2.412 MJ/kg. I couldn’t find what voltage was used for the “cutting edge” battery, but if we triple the battery voltage to 1200v that simply triples density to 7.2 MJ/kg. By contrast, hydrogen has the highest theoretical specific energy of any practical fuel at 142 MJ/kg.  Li-ion developments over the last decade *have* alleviated the practical issues for personal transport in developed countries. For personal vehicles, more mass isn’t much of an issue. A Tesla Model X weighs roughly 50% more (800kg) than an ICE SUV with comparable passenger volume (2,330 kg vs 1,590 for a RAV4). This is not viable for many industrial applications like trucks where the energy and range requirements are vastly different. The absolute maximum gross vehicle weight in the US is 80,000 lbs (26.2 metric tons) and 40 metric tons in Europe. To match the range of a diesel semi (1,600 - 3,200 km) would require using up nearly all the available gross weight just for batteries. Hydrogen power would actually *increase* the range of a semi relative to ICE tech.  Battery tech isn’t close to resolving issues for use in the developing world either, which contains a majority of the world’s population. The electric grid in many of these places struggles to power the basics, let alone millions of BEV chargers. A hydrogen car could theoretically drive nearly 20x the range of the best-case theoretical max for a BEV (or 120x current tech, 50x cutting edge), an especially attractive proposition here. For refueling infrastructure, you don’t need to be able to refuel/recharge at home or in essentially any municipality like with BEV or ICE vehicles if you only need to refuel once every year or two.  As for volatility, Li-ion has its own well-documented issues with battery fires that will likely increase as energy density increases, so I’m not sure BEVs have much of an advantage here.  Some smaller advantages: * Refueling speed - it only takes a few minutes to refuel a hydrogen cell * Negative emissions - the hydrogen-to-electricity converter in a car filters out pollutants like sulfur dioxide  Edit: Formatting', 'They are right.

With the battery innovations of the last ten years, it\'s now standard for basic hybrids, with lightweight batteries, to have a short mild-speeds all-electric range. Most car trips, even in the US, are less than three miles, and almost a third are less than a single mile. Gas engines are specially inefficient and dirty on short trips because they aren\'t warmed up. Making the whole national fleet able to handle very short trips on electricity would have *enormous* environmental and economic benefits.  In really severe cold, like the recent arctic blast that pummeled the Midwest, all-electric cars will struggle for the foreseeable future. Air source heat pumps are just not effective enough when the temperature is way below freezing. People want to feel confident their car can transport them safely in all conditions, and when it fails to perform to expectations in that kind of weather it can be life-threatening. Like ""range anxiety"" in general, cold-performance anxiety dissuades buyers and depresses the market to an extent disproportionate to buyers\' likelihood of actually facing those conditions.  The solution is staring us in the face. Outfitting electric cars with tiny fuel-burning heat systems that only kick in when it\'s really cold would be easy and effective. [People have done this DIY for a long time](https://insideevs.com/news/320555/video-utilizing-a-combustion-heater-in-a-fully-electric-car-a-users-story/), and it has had a huge positive impact on their range range in extreme conditions. These burners can be very clean-burning and efficient compared to an engine, and super lightweight.   (It\'s not a huge stretch to go from that to something that could be used in a pinch both for heat and as a series hybrid range extender.)  Yes, those burners would use fossil fuel and create carbon emissions, but their existence could dramatically *reduce* fossil fuel use, by getting more people using electricity to do the work of transportation. Electricity is much more efficient for doing work than combustion is, since most energy in fuel is exhausted as waste heat, but when heat is what you want, fuels are much more effective for producing it than electricity is. (That\'s a freshman thermodynamics thing.)  Legislators, regulators, and marketing, not engineering, hold us back here. We don\'t do anywhere near enough to get gas-only guzzlers out of the market. And we have regulatory categories, and incentives for both buyers and automakers, that treat all-electric cars as a completely different beast rather than as one endpoint of a plug-in hybrid spectrum. That actually slows the transition towards using electricity to do more of the work in transportation.', ""EV's are the future for the average consumer but the way they are being implemented right now is HORRIFICALLY incorrect.

Edit - lots of great responses below, thanks, and didn't mean to offend my neighbors north of the white wall haha  I'm in NY, and last week we had a cold spell. Friend rented a Tesla, and though it was charged they got significantly worse mileage, wound up getting stuck and needing a tow truck. I think there is a temperature effect on efficiency - and like anything when transportation is mission critical, having multiple fuel sources is probably a good thing. Why I see hybrids as a good stop gap for the next 10-20 years as those other issues are solved, whether through casing materials (buttwipe843), solid state (YamahaRyoko), or other. Extreme temperatures are an engineering problem, whether too hot (tires melting) or too cold (oil freezing in the pan), that's solvable with enough resources.  This was a good comment that expanded what my point was, in that home charging is a mission critical issue that isn't widely available:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/19e7v3q/comment/kjcde2s/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/19e7v3q/comment/kjcde2s/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)"", '[deleted]', 'Negative externality taxes', ""How profitable will it be when every other car manufacturer is electric and you're 10 years behind?

That is without even considering their reusability.  When your car batteries are no longer efficient enough to lug you around town, there is still another few decades of use possible for applications that do not care about weight, like as grid storage.  Once that is over, the battery can be recycled and all the important stuff can be pulled back out again and reused for the next batteries.

Had you asked me 15 years ago what I thought was going to be the big replacement for ICE cars, I would have said hydrogen as well.  That has not been how things worked out.  Hydrogen is pretty much in the exact same place it was 15 years ago, and batteries have gotten much more powerful while dropping to a sliver of a fraction of the price.

For comparison in an electric car from 100kWh about 90kWh can be used to move the car. So the rough math shows that EVs are almost 3 times more efficient then hydrogen powered cars.

Hydrogen does have its own problems, some of which have already been solved (or are further along) for BEVs. Infrastructure is probably the biggest advantage of BEVs over hydrogen power, but even that might be overstated.  Lithium Ion batteries are so far off from matching diesel/petrol in specific energy (energy per unit mass) that incremental improvements to current tech have no hope of closing the gap. And the specific energy of hydrogen fuel is triple that of diesel/petrol.  * Current Li-ion batteries: 0.97 MJ/kg (270 watt-hours/kg) * Cutting Edge Lithium: 2.5 MJ/kg (created by researchers in a lab in 2023, not production ready) * Diesel/Petrol: 45 MJ/kg (18x the energy density of cutting edge, 45x current tech) * Hydrogen: 120 MJ/kg (48x cutting edge, 120x current tech)  Current density represents an increase of roughly 0.6 MJ/kg over 10 years ago (density has tripled). If we assume it continues to triple every 1 years, then it would take until the late 2050s to match diesel/petrol. This is not realistic, however, as the theoretical maximum of Li-S batteries at 400v (Tesla battery voltage) is 2.412 MJ/kg. I couldn’t find what voltage was used for the “cutting edge” battery, but if we triple the battery voltage to 1200v that simply triples density to 7.2 MJ/kg. By contrast, hydrogen has the highest theoretical specific energy of any practical fuel at 142 MJ/kg.  Li-ion developments over the last decade *have* alleviated the practical issues for personal transport in developed countries. For personal vehicles, more mass isn’t much of an issue. A Tesla Model X weighs roughly 50% more (800kg) than an ICE SUV with comparable passenger volume (2,330 kg vs 1,590 for a RAV4). This is not viable for many industrial applications like trucks where the energy and range requirements are vastly different. The absolute maximum gross vehicle weight in the US is 80,000 lbs (26.2 metric tons) and 40 metric tons in Europe. To match the range of a diesel semi (1,600 - 3,200 km) would require using up nearly all the available gross weight just for batteries. Hydrogen power would actually *increase* the range of a semi relative to ICE tech.  Battery tech isn’t close to resolving issues for use in the developing world either, which contains a majority of the world’s population. The electric grid in many of these places struggles to power the basics, let alone millions of BEV chargers. A hydrogen car could theoretically drive nearly 20x the range of the best-case theoretical max for a BEV (or 120x current tech, 50x cutting edge), an especially attractive proposition here. For refueling infrastructure, you don’t need to be able to refuel/recharge at home or in essentially any municipality like with BEV or ICE vehicles if you only need to refuel once every year or two.  As for volatility, Li-ion has its own well-documented issues with battery fires that will likely increase as energy density increases, so I’m not sure BEVs have much of an advantage here.

And the specific energy of hydrogen fuel is triple that of diesel/petrol.  You're looking at the wrong figures.  You need to account for well to wheel efficiency.  For example, if an internal combustion engine can only get about 10% of the energy from combustion to the wheel while an EV can put 80-90% of the energy in the battery into the wheel then the difference in power density doesn't matter nearly as much.  The solid state EV vehicle batteries coming out in the next couple of years have ranges of like 600-700 miles, which is *significantly more* than gasoline powered vehicles."", '[deleted]', 'Holy shit this is so naive.

From what I can find BEV battery efficiency *starts* at 90% but degrades to 75% towards EOL, while ICE efficiency is not 10% but rather ranges from 20% up to 45% (for larger diesel vehicles).    Furthermore, my point in calling out specific energy as a limiting factor for BEVs was to highlight a shortcoming for BEVs in *replacing* ICE vehicles in certain segments (large commercial/industrial applications and personal vehicles the developing world).    To be clear, when it comes to “green” options I don’t see Hydrogen powered personal vehicles making much sense compared to BEVs for most people in developed countries. I think Toyota is wrong on that front.   Rather, my comment was in reply to someone who didn’t see any role for Hydrogen powered vehicles in a “greener” future. I believe BEVs are nowhere close to fulfilling needs of the commercial/industrial and developing world market segments. For the industrial/commercial segment, batteries have a very long way to go before they can meet energy requirements without having a serious impact on vehicle weight that limits utility. Hydrogen powered vehicles have their own challenges to overcome, but meeting energy requirements is not one of them.    The Tesla Semi has a range of just 500 miles vs up to 2,000 for a diesel truck. The batteries weigh roughly 8,000 lbs more than the diesel fuel (10k vs 2k) for 1/4 the range. This evident by the reported empty weight of a Tesla Semi vs a typical class 8 diesel (27,000 lbs vs 17,000 lbs). Add on a 10,000 lb trailer and the Tesla is left with a 20% lower payload capacity than the class 8 while having 1/4 the range. Want to increase the battery capacity to match the class 8 diesel range? Now we’re talking an empty weight of 67,000 lbs (including trailer). That’s a useful load capacity a little over 10,000 lbs vs the class 8 at a little over 50,000 lbs (80% lower for the same range).  Between the higher initial purchase cost, lower range, and lower capacity there’s a good reason no one outside of one Pepsi distro center in CA is using the Semi.

If your battery isn't holding a charge as expected, it's time for a new one.  Safe handling and disposal of Lithium batteries is important.  Old batteries should be stored in something airtight and that can have the air mostly removed. A good ziploc using the squish the air out before sealing tek is sufficient. Lithium fires feed on O2 directly, as in it causes the chemical reaction. You do a lot to prevent and minimize lithium fires by starving it of the O2 that kicks things off.  Lithiun is like sodium and calcium. If you expose raw Li, Na, or Ka to water and/or O2 it makes a fire very quickly. An intense one that feeds on O2 in an extremely exothermic chemical reaction kind of way.  Then, cover it with *clay* cat litter or sand, preferably sand. Silica will take the heat better than clay(silica is glass before it gets melted btw.) Dirt is less than ideal. It's a lot of water and organic matter potentially. Better than nothing in terms of starving O2. But a problem potentially if the battery pops off.  I use an old UN Frag Grenade ammo box I acquired(no frag grenades or ammo, it was empty.) Fill it with cat litter or sand to cover the spicy pillow. I leave that on my balcony until I can it to the locap Best Buy.  The idea is that if it does pop off it doesn't have the O2 to do much while the sand/litter absorbs the heat enough to give you time to yeet it somewhere not burny.(like a safe sidewalk or road, concrete of some kind away from ignitables.)  Then, take it to a recycling place. BestBuy does it here in Canada.

If it\'s unused for some time, battery health can ""recover"" a little.  Basically, a battery\'s charge is its voltage. You can check stuff like AA and AAA with a multimeter. Too much less than 1.5v and it\'s a dying battery(for AA & AAA.)  When I was a Seismic Exploration Troubleshooter, we checked batteries with a normal multimeter.   Point is that the battery health is based on how it holds a charge.  When a battery wears out, it can\'t hold as much of a charge. The fully charged voltage peaks lower and lower. It will drain faster and show a lower voltage when full.  If you use plugins, you can see the voltage for 100% charge and what your battery actually does.    Battery health is literally ActualChargedVoltage/FullChargeSpecVoltage and that result is turned into a percentage.  Your Deck comes at over 100% health. That\'s normal. 100% is more of an average of what to expect.   How much over 100% is variable. They choose a 100% that ensures no one gets a product at less than 100% health(aside from defects, etc)  Battery Health Tips:  -Avoid letting any Lithium battery get very low or fully drain. This screws the battery chemistry up.(This is specific to Lithium Batteries. NiCad required a full discharge because NiCad has a ""memory."")  -Getting too cold is bad for Lithium batteries. If it gets cold enough, it\'ll fail to hold a charge and discharge extremely fast. It takes getting to about -20C to crash batteries quickly. This was a big problem in Seismic Exploration.   -If it did get cold warm it up before charging. Charging cold will result in it appearing fully charged, but it\'s not and crashes quickly. (For seismic, this was a whole thing.)  -Keeping it fully charged all the time is also less than ideal. The Pass Through charging feature is intended to mitigate this. I would not worry about this with a SteamDeck. Other device though...  -If you leave a device off and unused for long periods, you need to occasionally plug it in to charge to 80-90%. Sitting idle and off, it will lose charge slowly over time.  This is what a Battery Storage Mode is for. It keeps the battery from degraging from sitting idle.  Overall, Lithium Batteries have drawbacks. But we don\'t have anything better yet.  We\'re at the limits of capacity and energy density with Lithium batteries.  Hopefully something better will be invented and come to market sooner than later.', 'Battery storage mode basicly shuts everything off. Probably also the data about the battery.

Your deck may go into battery storage mode in which case the power LED will blink three times and you will not be able to turn it on without plugging in the charger. If your deck goes into this mode, plug it in to perform the next step.   \\* Then hold the volume up button while pressing the power button. This will boot into the BIOS settings menu. The goal here is to leave the deck on this screen, which will not automatically dim, to drain the remainder of the battery. Leave the deck on this screen until it dies on its own.   \\* Now here is where we are going to deviate a bit from the steam support advice. Perform this BIOS drain 1-2 more times until the deck is so low on battery that it can no longer even make it all the way into the BIOS before dying. You may have to briefly plug the charger in to get it to restart. It seems that doing this step once may not be enough to fully drain the battery, which is the key to this entire process.   \\* From here there is one more crucial step to ensuring that the re-calibration is successful. The deck needs to remain off while charging overnight. If there is residual battery power left after the above steps, the deck may automatically power on and attempt to boot into SteamOS immediately upon plugging in the charger. If this happens you will need to unplug the charger, and as soon as the deck dies, plug it back in, so that it is completely dead and off while the charging process begins.   \\* Now let it charge overnight without touching it (at least 6-8 hours). In the morning it should still be off, and in my case even the power LED was not lit. Now try turning it on, entering desktop mode (by holding the power button), and checking the battery health in the taskbar. It should be over 90%.   In my case battery health is now reading 100% from 12% prior, and now seems to be reading and functioning correctly. I will update if I continue to have any issues.   I hope this helps those of you struggling with this issue, and prevents unnecessary RMA's. Best of luck!   Edit: Another tip is to avoid using a non OEM charger, which may predispose to calibration issues.  From this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/s/abPSg4Dy0Z [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/s/abPSg4Dy0Z)"", 'Whoops', ""I don't know, but that'd be a nice feature! My Samsung phone has that feature."", ""Yes, but you're missing the point. Most electronic devices that have a rechargeable battery are usually fucked if the battery dies/degrades. No matter what, every device out there with an internal rechargeable battery is going to die at some time. At least in this scenario it can either be replaced by the end user or by Valve. Having that option is HUGE. Also, if you have a Steam Deck, you have the means to replace the battery. It might not be a instant option if money is tight, but if your going to spend $400-650 on a device for something as frivolous as gaming, then at some point you hopefully have the means to drop $90 on a replacement battery."", ""*Not being charged* only applies until the power hits 85-95% or so. Then the battery is charged again in endless cycle (which could happen pretty often in some demanding games). So the energy level is constantly moving up and down with technically full battery. You are right with the heat though since when charging the battery is hottest.  I can't speak for Deck specifically abut I have exchanged and RMA'd tons of overblown batteries on HP Elitbook series notebooks and the cause was always the same - when used stationary in the company people worked with those notebooks being docked almost 100% of time. Meanwhile the emoloyees who travelled a lot who were only charging when they ran off the power had never any issue with batteries.  As for the Deck it would be always better to use the Deck in portable mode as far as battery health goes. OLED battery actually lasts pretty long when connected to TV with HDMI cable only. Docking the Deck when the battery is low is fine. On the other hand, playing with Deck being constantly docked for most of the time is simply asking for battery problems later."", ""Thank you for theses clarifications.  My gut has always told me these billion dollar companies are not designing devices where a low battery percentage is actually a harmfully low charge, but it's nice to hear that from someone who really knows their stuff."", '> This is why battery devices that have been left in a cupboard for a year sometimes don\'t work. The reason that we\'ll designed devices (e.g. Nintendo) are usually fine is that (a) they are designed to have a very low idle draw (just the self discharge) and (b) they set the ""low battery"" threshold quite high. This means that when the device stops working there is still plenty of discharging it can do before the battery gets damaged and it\'ll happen very slowly anyway.  Not to derail the topic but this is why I really wish having a hard battery cutoff either physically or in software (some laptops are starting to have this as an option now in the BIOS) to avoid this altogether was a more common feature.  This has been quite a pet peeve of mine. Way too many devices in my possession that I may not touch for weeks or months at a time that are battery powered with a built in battery and no proper full shutoff mode. Old spare Switch Joycons, Kindle\'s, etc.. While most have not completely died, the battery health has significantly degraded even with light use/low charge cycles.', 'Thanks for the corrections and additional information.  The batteries we used for the ARAM Aries and previous systems(name escapes me atm) were lithium cells of some kind.  The system before ARAM Aries changed to lithium batteries before Aries came about. Mostly to reduce size and weight. Aries always use lithium cells.  When they changed over to lithium, it was a ""thing"" when everyone first encountered batteries cratering when it got close to -20C or colder. Eventually, it became standard to have a battery shack with heating to prewarm the batteries before charging them.  For our purposes, using a multimeter in the field to measure voltage was mostly sufficient. It also explains why there were occasional batteries that read good voltages but cratered quickly when any load was put on them.  I wouldn\'t be surprised if ARAM had proper testers for their batteries. But the Seismic companies didn\'t want to pay for them, so we never knew they existed.', ""I've built a lifepo4 battery from raw cells and the research I've done and my experience accords with this.

This is a lot better than the usual arrangement (that you describe) which is effectively applying continuous charge cycles to the device.  However, it is roughly equivalent to storing the battery at 100%, which (as discussed elsewhere here) isn't the optimal for maintaining battery health."", 'Hmm, I assumed that was what caused my battery to get so bad, since there really hasn’t been anything else. Normally leaving batteries on a charger constantly is bad for them, and I can’t imagine a handful of flights did enough damage that I can lose 20% of my battery just scrolling through my game library.

However, your question of ""why worry?"" and even your follow up comment here just kind of seems like you don\'t get how even $90 can be something to worry about. Some people are buying used and or refurbished Decks or are saving/budgeting to get them. So worrying about some part going out and wanting to be aware of how to extend its life as much as possible is understandable. Especially if it\'s used or refurbished and replacing the battery would cost just under like half the cost of the whole device.   It\'s hard to grasp how even a double digit amount of money can be the difference between going under or not for some people, unless you\'ve dealt with that first hand.', 'What I\'ve learned is that there\'s a surprising amount of ""judgement call"" on where you set a lot of these limits. E.g. The ""stop using"" battery level threshold is a trade-off - setting it higher gives you more ""shelf life"", but takes away some usable battery capacity. A device I\'ve worked on sets that threshold at 30% capacity so that the product would be undamaged by 2 years in the cupboard! That decision was expensive - losing that 30% usable capacity meant we had to size up the battery and therefore the whole product to make it work, but that longevity was important to them.', 'why was his reply removed by the moderator?', 'I wish it were more universal that we could set the upper and lower charge bounds.

Same for how fast you charge it. I can\'t remember if that\'s ""safe"" for safety, or ""safe"" for battery damage.  3) If you take the battery cold and then bring it back up, it\'ll have less charge than if it had stayed warm over the same period of time.  I don\'t know off the top of my head if the cold has an inherent effect on the chemistry or if it\'s all an effect of the first point above - batteries are *always* discharging (due to self-discharge if nothing else) so possibly that constant discharge just uses up more capacity than it would otherwise.', 'First, thank you for enriching us with your experience, and a question How do you put It in battery storage mode ?', 'Granted I play in handheld mode but my R1 button keeps having issues with registering clicks.

If you are one of the lucky ones who has enough money to have a Steam account with games, and a nice Deck to play them on, and you're worrying about a god-damn 90 dollar purchase, then you should of not only bought all that shit to begin with, you shouldn't be spending any money on videogames."", ""Is this what steam deck's battery storage mode setting in bios does?

There\'ll be like 1 gate that\'s attached to the power button that then turns everything else on from there.  This is a classic thing you want - manufactured devices can easily sit in the supply chain for 3 months. Much more if you are doing manufacturing in batches. This is a situation that ""in use"" customer devices don\'t get and you want to manage it.   Someone will (likely) model battery level after manufacturing, charge loss during shipping etc., including what temperature it\'s being stored at (cold accelerates everything) to see how much capacity is still in the battery when it gets to the consumer. The lower the ""storage"" discharge level is, the longer it can be warehoused and still have charge when it gets to the consumer.

Most users of this subreddit who post and comment here daily are subscribers and see posts from here in their home feed (which by default is sorted by ""hot""). And they\'ll only see this megathread once, on the day that it\'s posted. Never after unless they deliberately search for it.  Users (subscribers and non-subscribers) who have issues with their battery life will find the monthly megathread easily but with near zero visibility from the rest of the users of this subreddit, they don\'t actually have anyone to look at their requests.   Previously, we had dozens of daily battery SOT posts. Reducing that to once a day megathread (that you can quickly scroll past by) that serves as a containment zone for them is a sweet spot, and also allows for daily visibility from users who aren\'t having issues with their battery life.   As for who\'s going to take on the burden of doing this daily, well, you can easily set up u/AutoModerator to post a stickied battery megathread everyday and even set it up to post a stickied comment on it, just like you do, with custom post titles/body text/comment text etc. Automod will automatically un-sticky the previous day\'s megathread.  \\\\\\  And in case this suggestion isn\'t accepted, my other suggestion for you would be to not delete your older megathreads, because Google doesn\'t (or barely) index deleted reddit threads.

People do it in the EU and Asia all the time and even in larger cities in NA. Its not bad. Its vastly more efficient for society for a lot of reasons to build up rather than out. You\'re much closer to things, even as close as walking distance to a lot of necessities so you don\'t *need* a car. You can just walk for 10mins instead of getting in your car and sitting in traffic for 30mins+ to order off the $1 menu. As a result of that there is less traffic and less emissions. Public transport in most of the EU and especially Asia is just as if not more efficient as personal vehicles, not only time wise but VAST cheaper cost wise and emissions. When you build up rather than out you\'re more efficiently using space and because you\'re closer to everything you have more opportunity job wise than you would otherwise have without having to drive for over an hour to work each day. There are just a ton of reasons why its better. It\'s pretty easy to research why. However in the US we want our private vehicle, our own personal yard, a house, etc. These things are nice however the problem comes in when **everybody** has that. You have to build out rather than up. So a trip somewhere not only uses much more energy but takes longer. You have to manage more area for things like running water and electricity too. The only real benefit is ""you have a yard"" but in every other regard it\'s a down side.  And to be clear I\'m not saying its wrong to want a yard or a car. Personally I\'m never giving up driving. I love it way to much. But there are downsides to it. And they\'re not really fixable by logic or reason because I **want** to drive and you **don\'t want** to sit next to someone on a public bus and we probably both want a yard.

Rt 1 gets a crazy traffic in the summer when people are trying to get from points north to the beach resort towns, but is otherwise a pretty empty stretch of highway connecting not much to not much.

I noticed that the type of people that were rallying around him were not the kind of people I like or even agree with. And Musk kept doubling down, to the point where he bought Twitter and lost all that money.

But the more I found out about him, it turned out that was all untrue.  He\'s obviously smart, but he\'s not brilliant. He is smart enough to surround himself with brilliant people and they do the work for him.  He\'s not really self-made. He did make some smart investments, but he didn\'t start from the bottom, like he would want everyone to believe. He\'s a heir to a millionaire emerald magnate. He had the opportunity to go to any school he wanted and start any business he wanted with no risk involved.  He\'s not really a futurist. He\'s not coming up with new technologies on his own. He just latches on to other people\'s high tech projects with funding. And speaking of that...  He\'s not the founder of Tesla. The company was founded in 2003 by two engineers: Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Musk stepped in half a year later with funding to keep the company going and as the chairman of the board ordered to be added as a ""founder"" to the corporate manifest.  Musk doesn\'t have an engineering background. He\'s got a Bachelor of Arts (not a Bachelor of Science) in Physics and a Bachelor of Science in economics. I\'m not one to discriminate people based on their education, but Musk himself wants to be perceived as an inventor and engineer, but he just isn\'t one. He hires engineers to do the job, that he then takes credit for.  Finally, it should be obvious now that Musk isn\'t trying to advance mankind. He advertised Teslas as the solution to transport-based carbon emissions, but he\'s vehemently opposed to public transit and tried to stop or at least stall the construction of the California High Speed Rail. Instead of using the Boring Company to burrow subway tunnels, he\'s making inefficient personal car tunnels. The Cybertruck is the antithesis of harmonious, sustainable living, but it was his pet project, because he wants an armoured vehicle to feel isolated from the plebs. His idea of going to Mars is rooted in his unwillingness to be told what to do. He hates that there are laws he has to obey, so he aims to make his own enclave, where what he says, goes.

Before that, I knew musk was a rich asshole, but I presumed he was at least intelligent enough to be at the helm of a tech company.

Then he started talking.', ""While I had known he was a dick for a while, the final nail in the coffin was when I saw videos of the underground loop (Tesla taxi tunnel) in Las Vegas.  If you've ever been to Vegas one of the first things you realize is that it's entirely set up to keep you trapped in one place. A walk from Treasure Island to Caesars Palace (only separated by The Mirage) is easily a 15 minute walk. Trying to walk from Treasure Island to The Excalibur (both more 'family friendly' casinos) is a 45+ minute walk. The sidewalk is predominantly un-shaded, crowded, and directly next to high volume traffic so you're breathing in that lovely exhaust. Las Vegas is also in the middle of the Nevada desert. Mixing alcohol + hot desert sun + long exposed walks outside is a recipe for a bad time. The readily available alternative of hailing a taxi or getting your car out of parking are both obscenely expensive and often will take you longer than the shitty walk.  All that to say the obvious solution is a high volume light rail line straight down the middle of the Vegas strip, OR a dedicated separated bus only lane in either direction. When Musk opted to build the loop I was hopeful he'd bring high volume electric busses and/or a trolley system in as a proof of concept. Instead we got the annoyingly inefficient and dangerous Tesla taxi service with a bunch of small semi-autonomous cars constantly chauffeuring people slowly back and forth.  It was the nail in the coffin for me that Elon starts projects with good intentions, but he fails to get out of the way of himself and inevitably implements a worse solution when the obvious (and frankly easier) one is dangling right in front of him.  Is he a hell spawn like some reflexively say when he comes up? No. But he's certainly got some personal demons, and his would-be saving grace of innovative tech is failing to pan out because he just can't help himself from throwing a wrench in every decent idea he has.  ***It's also important to remember that he alone likely did not make the sole decision about the loop (and a ton of the other failures made from his companies). He has made himself synonymous with these brands, however, and has not been shy about placing himself in the position as ring leader.

Once the “pedo guy” incident happened, I thought “oh well, he’s a douchebag but at least he makes good cars”. Then his hard right turn into conspiracy-land and anti-vaccine rhetoric in conjunction with the pandemic completely turned my opinion against him, permanently. Everything he’s done and said since then has reinforced that feeling. I bought another Tesla since then, and I’m thrilled with the car but had major second thoughts because of the CEO. I have family who ask me how I could possibly buy the car if I can’t stand the CEO, and they have a point, but 1. I know nothing about all the other car company CEOs, and don’t feel like doing the research to see which CEO has the best ethics 2. The Tesla is still by far the best value for an electric car for a family that often travels. We have been driving electric since 2014 and haven’t bought a tank of gas in years, and don’t plan on ever going back. Now that Tesla is opening up their Supercharger network, we’ve replaced one of our two Teslas with a different brand (the supercharger network is a total game changer, spoken from experience road-tripping in both a Tesla and a non-Tesla EV).  Edit/addendum: 1. No of course I don’t want to “support” this terrible person. I agree that he is one of the few CEOs whose views and opinions are very public and more subject to scrutiny, and also acknowledge that doesn’t make him immune to criticism. I care more about the overall company’s impact than its CEO. I’m not trying to enrich him, but I do still think that Tesla as a company has provided/is still providing an important service by popularizing electric cars, which I personally believe to be a minor but important part of what we as a society need to move towards to minimize transport contributions to climate change (along with decarbonizing the grid, emphasizing mass transit, and de-emphasizing personal automobile ownership in general). 2. Yes, of course I know how to open the rear door in event of a Tesla power failure (which is exceptionally rare, much rarer than in an ICE vehicle).

By the time of the billionaire space race, public attitudes and priorities had changed.

He had actual empathy, he didn’t ignore it and he’s not a billionaire anymore… he made a bunch of massive trust funds and generate their own wealth to keep the good works going after he’s gone and made sure that it’s legally protected from greedy assholes. I can’t believe I forgot his name but I saw a documentary about him a few years ago.

It\'s not a form a of Major Depressive Disorder it\'s own thing.   This is how I think of it: you have a graph with an x and y axis that only shows the 1st and 4th quadrent. Also let\'s say between (0,1) and (0, -1) represents being content and above that ""happiness"" and below that ""sadness"". For people with PDD they are consistently right below (0, -1). For most of my life i really did not experience and know what ""happiness"" feels like. To me just going above (0, 1) for short periods of time were absolutely euphoric when having normal human interactions that were able to go above being content, which still was rare. I was always the ""old soul"". To me being marginally ""sad"" was just ""normal"" and usually being just marginally ""sad"" wasn\'t bad per se. To me that was life. HOWEVER with PDD the main thing that can make it debilitating is when you have your dips in the ""mood function"". Since I was already below (0, -1) the dips into major sadness were extreme and difficult to bear. Luckily, I only have tried to end it once in my life and I immediately regretted it and was able to get the meds to counteract a Tylenol overdose. Before the infusions I strived to just be content. Since I rarely experienced happiness, anything that gave me that feeling was addictive because like i said before just the smallest amount of happiness that a ""normal"" person experiences was absolutely euphoric. That may sound like BPDs however I do not have that as that\'s the first thing looked for before diagnosing PDD. To me being marginally  ""sad"" the vast majority of the time was what life was and the small glimmers of happiness literally felt like being on drugs.   Nothing worked therapy did nothing, the normal drugs made it worst. Wellbutrin helped some but not enough to help much. The ketamine infusions completely changed my life. It works by binding to NMDA receptors and increasing the extracellular Glutamate levels and disinhibiting GABAergic receptors which can for people with depression stimulate neurons and encourage the creation of more synapses, better than SSRIs, which ""eliminates"" the depression. Paradoxically for someone who is ""normal"" ketamine can actually induce long term depression.   For the first time in my life I am regularly content and happiness actually feels normal and is not euphoric. Absolutely game changer. A certain psychedelic starting with an L also did the same thing when I did it once in college. Literally for nearly two years I was in ""remission."" We are in a exciting time in mental health treatment. However Ketamine needs to be treated with respect. It is dangerous when not used under a doctors supervison. If anyone who is reading experiences a similar things first talk with your doctor. DON\'T SELF MEDICATE.', ""They said they take it to treat dysthymia, which is a kind of depressive disorder.

Everyone has their preferences with drugs. I can understand why some enjoy it. It\'s important to have all experiences shared with this as it’s pretty new on the mental health ""battlefield.""

It\'s important to find clinics that actually care about your journey and not the easy money to be made.', 'The place I went would give either promethazine or Zofran before or after the infusion.

After the first time I was in ""happiness"" part of emotions and for the first time in my life it wasn\'t euphoric. I actually felt mostly ""normal.""  I don\'t drink, however I do use cannabis some and unfortunately before the ketamine I was using opioid pills to stave off the worst parts of PDD. One of the secondary effects of the infusions was I no longer felt the need and hunger for opioids. I can happily say I have been off them, recreationally at least as I had a few surgeries recently and I didn\'t feel the need to abuse them, for 4 and half years now.  I am sorry it didn\'t work out for you, I hope nothing I say diminishes your experience or distracts from your journey! I know from what the doctor at my clinic says for some people it can takes months of weekly infusions before the long lasting effects show themselves, and then switching to long breaks between infusions to enforce the brain changes. I hope things for you are at least content and safe for you! I know how frustrating finding treatment that works can be', 'It\'s different from individual to individual. Heck we really still don\'t know the dosage necessary for the effects to take root. We know high doses that run up right to the edge of being anesthetic are probably required but length and frequency is still not certain.   For me I got really lucky that even after the first dose that the come down seemed to already be causing some change. Those next few days were much better than any other day in my life at that time. I then had 5 or 6 weeks of 1 infusion a week, then was able to go 4 months before needing another dose (still had many symptoms of PDD however it was improving). Then I was able to go about 7-8 months before needing another dose. And then I was able to go with 1 infusion about every year. I would say by year 2 I was what I would call in ""remission"" from PDD. Once I start having the PDD symptoms for a couple weeks time I know I need to get another infusion.   I would say it wasn\'t until month 8 or 9 that I was significantly improved. However I know some people in the clinic were getting infusions every 2 weeks for a year and then had improvement. However in the US, I am assuming you are in Europe, the nasal version is not available by Rx outside of inpatient treatment on a psych floor. From what I have read, studies still very limited, the infusions have better efficacy as actual ketamine is a racemic of esketamine and arketamine. Arketamine is potentially better at creating longterm change in the brain as it has more of the glutamatergic effects. The nasal version is esketamine which is being shown to be one of the most effective treatments for emergency mental health scenarios. However it\'s ability to keep the brain in a long-term state of synaptic plasticity is somewhat iffy. Mainly because esketamine does most of its job by being a highly potent dopamine antagonist. That\'s one reason it makes a good emergency medicine for mental health crises.   I don\'t know if infusions are offered wherever in Europe you are but it may be more effective and warrant a discussion with your doctors. However it is much more intense than the nasal sprays. Esketamine is actually considered the part of ketamine that makes it so fun for others as it\'s a very potent dopamine binder. The prevailing theory is that  glutamatergic affects are the ones desired as glutamate is very good at creating plasticity in the brain', ""Substances can't give you a personality disorder all by themselves but they absolutely have a tendency to make them worse, sometimes a lot worse  Addiction is often the first domino that starts the chain reaction of decompensation and collapse"", 'No', 'Ok hold up.

If you take more you can get strong visuals and a kind of ego death - effectively internal experiences continue but you swim in and out of forgetting you’re a person. It’s really hard to explain. I find a high dose of ketamine a much, much bigger challenge to ‘ordinary reality’ than, say, a high dose of acid - and although you won’t be going anywhere so you look sedated from the outside, on the inside there will be all sorts going on. Some people love it if they’re ok with that kind of deep, dreamlike trip, but others find it really scary. As I say though, small bumps are a totally different experience, and very light touch.

My experience with M3 is when I had a loaner for a few days while in service.  You’re pretty much spot on with your comparison, so no need to go into the differences between the 2 since you’re well aware.  What I will say is the experience you get from actually driving the cars:  M3 **feels** like a small metal box with basic amenities and trim that “gets the job done” and nothing special to write home about. Kinda like a basic trim 4-door Honda Accord/Toyota Corolla with awesome acceleration.  MS **feels** like a solid large high-end (dare I say “luxury”?) sedan with a few cool bells and whistles that most other cars don’t have (ie air suspension).  So no real surprises there with, “you get what you pay for” when it comes to features, build quality, etc.  What did surprise me however was the SIZE difference. The MS is a much bigger car than M3, and where it became clear was when I parked in a tight spot that I frequently park in. In the MS I would have to keep my drivers side as close to the edge as I could to have a reasonable amount of space to the car that is always parked on my passenger side. When I parked there in the M3, I did what I normally would do and ended up with what could have been another parking space for a big Harley Davidson with saddle bags. Well, not really but you get what I mean 😜  **So TL;DR:**  Get the MS if you can afford it and don’t mind driving around in a full size sedan.  Get the M3 if you want to save $$ and have a car that gets the job done with no frills.  Caveat: This is an older M3 of course. The new Highland M3 upgrade looks to close the gap between the “luxury” of the MS and the “basics” of the old M3 significantly.   If you’re **really** teetering on the fence and there’s nothing pulling you towards the MS, I would probably recommend M3 Highland tbh.  Final note: what pulled me to the MS was the Plaid option of course. No explanation necessary 😏', ""No rear passengers + no kids = Model 3.

If you don’t care much for your car or perceided status and just want it to be low cost, get the Model 3. Range is fine. I have a Model Y and even though it’s only standard range, I only charge it up to 65% on my lvl 1 charger because my daily commute usually isn’t more than 20 miles.

I find the MS a little bit smoother on it’s version of FSD, but they both do just fine at handling highways (any traffic density is fine) and low density traffic city driving.  I got used to the center screen only in the MY pretty quickly, but it’s a little spooky at night since there’s nothing lit up in front of the steering wheel.  In practice, my wife drives the MS exclusively but I drive it on road trips.  We use the MY for towing our bicycles and when needing it’s roof rack, so not all trips but many where we plan outdoor activities.  The MS seems to have a bit better useful range most likely due to its larger battery since the MY seems to use almost as many Wh/mi.

The ride is MUCH better in the S even when comparing to the 18"" wheels on the 3. The noise level reduction and overall comfort is also a ton better.  As someone who is a bit of an aggressive driver and floors it a decent amount on the highway to pass, the S LR is SO much quicker at highway speeds. Try hammering the pedal at 65-70 MPH and you\'ll definitely notice.  I, too, don\'t really see the appeal of the center instrument panel. I actually prefer having the speed limit on the main screen (Model 3) over the center instrument panel on the S. Freeing up the visualizations from the center screen to the instrument panel is its one pro imo since it lets you view the map and full sized camera views simultaneously on the S.', 'I’d like to know more about the handling and suspension such as steering feel, quickness, body roll, harshness over bumps, cornering capability, etc.  Also FYI the different in speed between the 3 Performance and refreshed S Long Range is only noticeable above 60mph.

It's actually concerning to see so many people selling them so quickly and taking such a loss, I'm not sure why that is.  If I was going used, I'd probably pickup a Plaid as the price difference seems minimal, though I lose out on the range. But for the price, comfort, and straight-line performance, it seems like a no-brainer if I was in the market.  I'm interested in the Highland performance but details are minimal at this point.

I also wrote up a similar post with a lot of your same points. https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/s/PZLiQUo2Gy  The turn signals being on the steering wheel is a solution to a problem that didn’t exist. It’s not terrible once you’re used to it, but it’s entirely unnecessary and was likely 100% a cost cutting measure. I can’t imagine it actually saves a considerable amount of money though because it’s not like the stalks are expensive to produce. Also, FYI, you can simply hold the button down in your multiple lane change scenario. (Not justifying it, just more of a friendly FYI if you didn’t know.)  One thing I saw a lot of people complain about was having the gear selector on the screen. While I prefer the gear selector stalk on the Model 3, auto shift is pretty accurate most of the time and swiping on the screen is honestly no more of a hassle than reaching down for a gear selector by the center console like most cars. It’s really only for three-point turns when it’s slightly annoying.   I purchased my S when they started at about $89,000. I bought an inventory model that was marked down to $80,000 and got a $1,000 loyalty credit, so at the time I got a great deal. Had I waited just two weeks, though, I would have saved a considerable amount when they dropped the price — _or_ I could have more comfortably afforded a Plaid. I would have probably gotten a Plaid in that scenario. I’m in that sweet spot income-wise where I wouldn’t have qualified for the federal tax credit, so getting another Model 3 wasn’t as enticing, but enough that spending $20k more on a Plaid just for the speed would have been a bit of a stretch. Could I have afforded it? Yes, but I couldn’t justify $20k more for what would have ultimately just been a flex.', 'I went from a 2022 M3LR to a 2023 Model S. Everything said by OP I agree with though I will say this. The Model 3 definitely feels more nimble being a smaller and lighter car and with the Highland coming into production soon I’d be curious to see how that feels compared to my S. The S is an upgrade all around but it dives like a large luxury sedan. My driving style is definitely more Model 3 and I’d consider going back if the new incoming model is as good as we think it’s going to be. I need to sit in it and drive it first.', ""11 months ago, I was in the same spot. Ready to move on from my '20 Model 3 P, so I drove a base '22 Model S.

Agreed.  This is really my only complaint with all of the input hardware reduction in the new S and X.  My X was an inventory vehicle and came with the yoke.  I had been considering replacing it immediately with the wheel until the Tesla associate pointed out that the turn signals are still buttons on the wheel.  It turns out, the yoke is perfectly easy to get to used to.

Spot on.    I’ll add the following comments…   The horn button being a capacitive button rather than on the middle of the steering wheel is a major design error for two reasons: one is that I hit it by accident all the time using the right thumb wheel; and secondly years of driving cars with the horn in the middle means that in a panic situation the horn isn’t available to my instinct. I think this is a dumb design that should be fixed immediately.   The yoke looks cool, and is functional, and the shape has few downsides to me. I got used to it right away. Even 3-point turns are no problem at all. The only drawback is that you cannot steer with your knee. Still, I’ll take it.   I’d rather have stalks for the turn signals. The capacitive buttons are ok, and are aesthetically better, but I’d rather have a functional stalk as that paradigm “just works” and is intuitive to almost any driver.   It’s so much quieter than the 3. Love that.   The turn radius on the S is wider.   The repeater cameras that come up with turn signals should be on the instrument cluster, not the touch screen.   Now, whether these upgrades are worth the cost difference is a personal decision. But completely agree with OP.', ""Good write up. Suspension controls on Model S (3/Y don't have) is night and day better. Had Y Performance, but even standard Y, rides like an old Wrangler that required and kidney belt. Terrible.

My current signal strategy is to use my left fingers to hit the turn signal, since my hand is already next to that stalk, but I don't have a way of hitting the capacitive buttons safely.

Given the upcoming M3 Highland that apparently has significant upgrades in suspension and interior comfort ( at 25-30k less), I wonder how the current S would stack against it.   My main issue with the S is its size- too large ( wide) for day to day driving and city/ garage  parking. Agree it’s good for highway driving.

There are plenty of stock 3 Ps that will do around 3.2 including rollout, and a few have even done 3.1 including rollout, but most stock S LRs can’t break 3.3 including rollout, and none have ever recorded a 3.1 like Tesla claims they should be able to.

The 3 is still great; does everything I need it to do, and even as a much cheaper car than the S, is by and far the most I’ve ever paid for a vehicle.  I don’t think I can ever justify the price of an S.  Hell, the 3 is still too expensive for a lot of people.

I've put quite a few miles on an X and while it's quick, it makes it's size known."", 'I certainly agree it\'s a helluva car and just finished checking out the used market where you can now scoop up a 2022 Plaid S w/35K miles for $62K.   That said I dont know if I\'d consider it extremely underrated.. as the reason most people aren\'t interested because they already know exactly what they are getting.  There\'s no nice way to put this.. but the Model S is old news.   Dont get me wrong it still looks awesome, has supercar performance and incredible range.   But it\'s been pretty much the same vehicle for over 10 years now.  Yes it\'s been thoroughly updated.. but it still looks very much the same as it has for a really long time now.  Good luck finding any random person off the street who can tell a 2016 from a 2024.  People tend to like new cars.  And by new.. I mean NEW!!  Something they haven’t seen before.  Someone shopping for a new car tends to want something that looks & feels different.. than what they\'ve already seen for 10 years.  IMO the Model S biggest problem is way too much of that ""been there, done that"" feeling.  It’s also still really expensive.   Yes you lucked up on a demo Plaid model for $74K.. the MSRP on a new Model S Plaid is $88K.  And it doesn’t qualify for any IRS tax credits.  So for the typical buyer.. ordering a long range Model 3 for $35,000 or long range Model Y for $37,000 (including tax credits).. means getting 300 miles of range and still getting the whole Tesla “experience”.  More importantly the typical driver in a Model 3 or Y is going to do 99% of anything a Model S would do.. while paying half the price.   How many times a year do you think a typical driver wants to do 0-60 in 2 seconds or needs to drive 400 miles non-stop?  And is that really worth another $50,000?  All the above are reasons why Tesla now only sells around 5,000 new Model S every quarter.  It’s also why something like 97% of the vehicles Tesla has sold this year were a Model 3 or Y.    The amount of value the 3 & Y offer is what the vast majority of car buyers are looking for.   At least the Model X has a 3rd row big enough to sit 7 adults comfortably to help justify its huge price.. meanwhile a 5-seater Model S is now basically a niche vehicle that’s grown really long in the tooth.', 'Previous to my first Model S in 2016, I use to trade in cars on average every 18 months. I’ve had 13 vehicles since 2000. Since then, I traded our base 2016 S60/75 to a 2018 P100D and don’t feel anything else would be a significant upgrade for the cost. I haven’t driven a Plaid since I would probably find a way to justify the upgrade.  I looked at a Taycan but for the same reasons you mentioned, didn’t do anything. It is also ridiculously expensive to maintain, $3k 12v battery replacement for example. I also like the size of the S and how much cargo space it has and ease of the hatch.   I test drove the Lucid at an event. It was nice but felt smaller in the drivers seat. The ride wasn’t as smooth as I expected. The trunk is also more conventional than a hatchback. I also don’t like the styling very much and it hasn’t grown on me over the years.', 'Love my 2020 MS LR+.  Like others, I was a frequent car changer.

For example:  OP Said:   *""It’s insanely comfortable, luxurious to me.\xa0""*  While luxury style can generally be subjective, the general consensus by most is that the Model S (or any cars in Tesla\'s line up) fall short in materials quality, features, comfort, and design. The Model S is pretty good, but its really just not on par with luxury german brands (often way better seats - both in bolster/bucket like design, cushioning, leather, message, etc), or even the best the South Korea can offer (Genesis).   Touch materials are also largely lighter weight plastics. The design language is good, but its really your typical plastic interior from your run-of-the-mill japanese econbox like on an accord or camery.  Does any of this actually make for a terrible experience? Depends on what you\'re looking for. A lot of people are completely satisfied with the interior quality of the Model S - but that absolutely does not make it ""on par"" with its peers. It just means its good enough -to you-.   I think the Model S\'s interior is rated exactly where its at - not under, not over rated. Its just a plain inteiror with a few bells and whistles, with great design language. Tesla just didn\'t feel the need to follow that design language with expensive materials; giving it a feel that\'s below average for its price point.     Also material choice has nothing to do with build quality. The Model S interior is well built, and the material choice clearly holds up (doesn\'t creak or squeal or rub). Good job, Tesla.  I think the core issue with the Model S and its current level of appreciation is that its a luxury car price without a competitive luxury car feature set. If people want a comfortable highway tourer or GT car, the Model S just lacks that little extra driver-oriented luxury that other brands carry. And its rated as such. Its still a great car. Its just not the obvious choice; like a Model Y would be against its peers.', 'You can get a used model s long rage 2019 for around 30k', 'I traded my S for a new Y and although both are great cars I do miss a lot about the S.

Moreover, back seat passengers never appreciated the suspension as they found it too hard, even on comfort. My family prefers the X now, and it's a fantastic car for a family use. But for every day commute, I'd go back to the S if I could. Time will tell how I feel after I drive the CT for a while, though I don't think the perception would change.

For example, the controls to adjust the mirror and wheel *are* physical. Those knobs on the steering wheel are not touch screens.

From a user interface standpoint, it is absurd to add another button, the wiring for that button, sensors, allocate dash space, all for something that most drivers do perhaps twice a year, especially when Teslas recall those settings per-driver -- a luxury feature. Teslas have many luxury features that are rare even in luxury cars, but are often overlooked when making a list of ""this is what BMWs have, and here are the BMW features that Teslas do not have."" I can click the right steering wheel button and say, ""Make it colder"" and it actually works, unlike BMW\'s which think I am talking to them every time I say the car brand, and after a command like the former, happily respond with something like ""Navigating to Boulder, Colorado..."". Thus, Tesla has a perfectly good, if not better, answer to yet more buttons upon buttons in the cabin. Physical internal door latches -- those are present (at least in the front), and I would consider the electric ones to be the luxury variant.  Electric sun blinds are often present in much more expensive cars, or are an expensive option, e.g. with the 5-series. If we are allowing for optionals, why not include aftermarket? Trunk kick liftgates, for example, have been available since around 2020.  With those things said, you are right about some traditional luxury features that Tesla has no answer to. A HUD. 3D camera view (coming soon for years now). blind spot lights in the mirrors, while not a luxury feature, would be nice.   The higher-quality feeling of traditional luxury interiors is subjectively, but really objectively, a good point.

If it can confidently determine attentiveness with the camera, it prompts for far fewer steering wheel nudges.

That means that if you partially obscure the camera so it can no longer see the driver's seat, it falls back to the old, steering wheel only attentiveness checks.  Not that I'm advocating bypassing a safety system. But when you're in the middle of a lane change, glancing at the side mirror or the screen for the side camera view, and the car starts throwing a fit, beeping and flashing red text on the screen, reacting to and reading that to figure out what's going on can be a little...unsafe.

Let’s say you wanted to prevent FSD from changing lanes as your exit approached, you could simply cancel the navigation in which case the car will just go straight forever until you enter in a destination again.
