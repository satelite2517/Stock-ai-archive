1,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.7597905993461609,There's a small sell-off virtually every time they announce new products.
2,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9932177662849426,I wonder if I will finally be able to search my email in a reliable manner
3,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.999523401260376, Or if Apple will stop creating 5 contacts for the same person in 3 different address books
4,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9980948567390442, I won't hold my breath.
5,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.8728116154670715,"Apple is one of the most valuable companies on the planet, I don't think anyone sane is underestimating them, even if there's some skepticism over their current direction with AI."
6,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9998075366020204,It does seem very well integrated into the entire ecosystem and apps
7,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9979494214057922,"And I think in the near future, you‘ll be able to choose whatever AI model you want to go hand in hand with Apple Intelligence so that‘s a big plus as well"
8,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.931251049041748,"It also helps them catch up, because their own model while light weight and competent enough, is not on the level of Chatgpt yet"
9,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9994718432426452,Some privacy focus is also great to hear about
10,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.999842405319214,"The stock market didn‘t like it, but I‘m very excited for it and what‘s ahead."
11,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9610523581504822,"I think so too, iPhone 16 generation should get a big release later this year too."
12,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9981510043144226,I think gating the AI features to only iPhone 15 and newer is a great move
13,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9904819130897522,Lots of sentiment over the past year have been not upgrading their iphone unless there are significant changes

16,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9959765076637268, Edit: Apple is only making AI available on 15 pro (this year's top model) and later
17,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9992942810058594,"So, on the downside, my 14 pro max won't have it, with only 6 GB of RAM"
18,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9982520937919616,"Of course, Apple could quantize their model to run on 6 GB of RAM, but they opted not to"
19,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.7688677906990051,"So, driving upgrades is their AI monetization model, which is bad for me as a consumer but fine as an investor"
20,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9770739674568176,"I'm going to continue to hold Apple, and hold AAPU only for another couple days (which is a very modest position)"

24,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9987046718597412,Some of the features seemed targeted at keeping the Apple ecosystem special and walled off from android
25,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9931166172027588,"That blue/green text message thing, while kind of dumb when you think about it, was definitely a big deal for keeping Apple users around"
26,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9913384914398192," On the other hand I’m not seeing any big differentiators, any huge value-adds that change the current iPhone revenue"
27,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9992403984069824,Is any of this going to drive more device purchases? Probably not
28,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9959532022476196,Apple has been ramping their service offerings up for a while to drive more revenue
29,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.8158735036849976,But their primary is still in device sales
30,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9979154467582704,Without that new consumer product innovation in the last few years (Vision notwithstanding) I feel like Apple might be peaking for a few years.
31,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.982139766216278,"Your post could have otherwise be written as ""I have an iPhone and think it's the best, so I'll buy more stock based on them saying something something AI"""
32,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9998867511749268,I love what I saw
33,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9991486072540284,"Will we see crazy growth like before? Maybe not, but this continues to be  strong company who delivers high quality products to the consumer and I think it’s a great stock to hold for a while still."
34,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9846694469451904,"Seems like it’s been a soft aapl all year, no?  I’m long but SPY is outperforming all year."

36,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9979115128517152,It would appear things have reversed slightly  :)
37,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9998759031295776,That’s interesting
38,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9707472920417786,"You look at Google, at Amazon, Microsoft, they’re all heavily into AI for the enterprise, the cloud, server space"
39,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.7577740550041199,"AI for business processes, algorithms etc"
40,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9994994401931764,which makes sense
41,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9992851614952089,They don’t make their money from the consumer

44,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.7082251310348511,Makes sense all their AI endeavors will be in the consumer space
45,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.955207884311676,"Is there even another major player in the race? Might take a while before something more substantial than a beta release comes out, but Apple might actually be first in for once"
46,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9854416847229004, If they can pull it off.

58,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.999345600605011,I'm guessing OP doesn't have an Android phone if he thinks Google doesn't bring AI into everyday tasks.

62,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9994169473648072,How does this actually make Apple money? Are they gonna make people pay for it? Or is it gonna only be included with Apple one?

1244,2024-05-08 23:07:32,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9997219443321228,They did 4.5% increase in dividend … and like 5% buyback YoY so overall yes… I think they are rewarding long term holders with positive gains…
1245,2024-05-08 23:07:32,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.8225138187408447,On point 4 it’s been buybacks… since years prior it was just a cash hoard… 110 billion in cash they can buy entire industry or even a country… it just not going to happen they can use all that cash pile for r and d… and car doesn’t seem like an ideal spot cause the margins got crushed in EV… look at Tesla… I must admit I am a fanboy… either Vision Pro gets better and the cost comes to under 2k in the long term or the watch gets approved for glucose monitoring and doesn’t need needle sticks… I can see insurance companies rather pay for a watch every 5-10 years than boxes of test strips that are like 125 a box a month… they are mature and huge… which will impair growth… I am a little worried about the near term but not so worried about the long term…

1661,2024-05-08 23:07:32,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9959633350372314,Well Apple is slow at raising dividends… I think even thought Apple gave dividends before Microsoft jobs hated the idea of dividends… but financially Apple has been raising dividends 4.5% average YoY over last 5 years but does that mean it will beat inflation? I dunno but price appreciation can happen even if sales are flat… other made the note that Apple is the number 1-10 slot for most buybacks… something only google facebook is close to taking… and in reality they have repurchased over half of their outstanding share count and reduced dividend payouts by 10-15% so with that type of long time horizon Apple will be a financial fortress… I was worried for the time it’s dipped but all I did was buy more… once I cross maybe 10% I will stop buying but again price appreciation can happen with flat growth… with share buybacks… look at autozone they are over 2k a share…long winded way of saying they can have price appreciation and increase dividends to the same 0.5% no problem for a long time… that’s what we want as investors…
1662,2024-05-08 23:07:32,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9954238533973694,Some have commented if you are discipline with dividend collecting and reallocating overall you might be able to inch out some better gains… I would have to agree… if you have higher individual stock holdings or have high conviction on a stock with possible growth but no steady dividend to reinvest… or not significant… my initial Apple purchase price is about 41 dollars and .25 quarterly dividend means  I am getting 2.43% based on cost and 551% appreciation… only problem was I didn’t buy more!!!
