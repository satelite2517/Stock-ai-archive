1,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.7597905993461609,There's a small sell-off virtually every time they announce new products.
2,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9932177662849426,I wonder if I will finally be able to search my email in a reliable manner
3,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.999523401260376, Or if Apple will stop creating 5 contacts for the same person in 3 different address books
4,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9980948567390442, I won't hold my breath.

8,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.931251049041748,"It also helps them catch up, because their own model while light weight and competent enough, is not on the level of Chatgpt yet"

17,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9992942810058594,"So, on the downside, my 14 pro max won't have it, with only 6 GB of RAM"
18,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9982520937919616,"Of course, Apple could quantize their model to run on 6 GB of RAM, but they opted not to"
19,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.7688677906990051,"So, driving upgrades is their AI monetization model, which is bad for me as a consumer but fine as an investor"

25,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9931166172027588,"That blue/green text message thing, while kind of dumb when you think about it, was definitely a big deal for keeping Apple users around"
26,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9913384914398192," On the other hand I‚Äôm not seeing any big differentiators, any huge value-adds that change the current iPhone revenue"
27,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9992403984069824,Is any of this going to drive more device purchases? Probably not

33,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9991486072540284,"Will we see crazy growth like before? Maybe not, but this continues to be  strong company who delivers high quality products to the consumer and I think it‚Äôs a great stock to hold for a while still."
34,2024-06-11 03:43:36,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9846694469451904,"Seems like it‚Äôs been a soft aapl all year, no?  I‚Äôm long but SPY is outperforming all year."
