Look mom I could move my icons anywhere now. <br><br>It only took 17 years. 😂
I hope my new IPad Pro M4 Chip can handle the Calculator app 😬
5 minutes into it I thought this was an SNL content😂 …so funny how hyped the executives are for introducing “rearranging apps” or “adding emojis to the text response”…!?
He needed to stand on the roof to say that?
Literally just released a new powerhouse iPad and the only update is a calculator. It’s like they don’t want to sell them 😂😂
Did i accidentally log on to a Samsung event???
A CALCULATOR FOR iPad !! Just 10 years later tho...
Let’s just wait until the iPhone 20. It will be better than iPhone 19.
The main draw of the iPhone SE for me has always been its small size. Making it the same size as the mainline phones killed my interest. I&#39;m so sick of having a huge phone.
They literally said to skip the 15 because 16 was the best thing ever. Now it’s the 17? So many people skipped this past year.
Can’t wait for the 16 pro max coming from the 13 pro max. Better have some massive battery gains. Screw the 17 slim. Won’t have a better battery
They should make the “slim” a flip phone
I think Tim and apple should take more suggestions on what its consumers really want.
"I’m an Apple product owner across the entire ecosystem, but the Vision Pro costs way too much."
I always thought this is what google glass was supposed to be. Years later we got these huge snow goggles.
Can you just put the headband in your mouth and just chew it between your teeth a bit - what does it feel like?
Dear headset makers: I just want a helmet
Marques is the only person who actually looks cool wearing this thing
"Bruh. Imagine using this as an Italian…<br>You meet your friend and speak like this 🤌🏻🤏🏻🤌🏻🫴🏻🤙🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻 and the next thing you find out is that the Vision Pro opened a thousand tabs, ordered pizza and the next Uber ride to the Colosseum 😬"
"Can&#39;t wait to hear the &#39;&#39;scratches at level 6, with deeper grooves at level 7&#39;&#39;<br><br>This didn&#39;t age well."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1380"">23:00</a> unfortunately wearing the Vision Pro will likely also start an annoying awkward conversation too lol"
Peak MKBHD is describing the real sensation of his finger and thumb making contact as ‘haptic feedback’ 😂😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1581"">26:21</a> Dude looked like a long lost family member greeting him in the afterlife xD"
Apple: the new ipad pro is the thinnest apple product ever<br>Apple polishing cloth: Am I a joke to you
Disappointed there wasn&#39;t an updated iPad Mini..
All that power still no calculator 😂
bro I don’t need a thinner ipad. just make the battery bigger instead
Bro what&#39;s the point of another most powerful iPad ever if iPad os prevents you from doing anything useful with the hardware.
The only good thing about this announcement is that it makes the 10th gen iPad $349 now.
"Jerryrig is coming for that 5.3 mm, cant wait"
"&quot;I want an even thinner iPad&quot;, said no one ever."
Will it bend?
"Apple’s strategy is quite confusing. It feels like they just released the M3-powered MacBook, and now they’re launching the M4-powered iPad Pro. It seems a bit early for the M4 on the iPad. Moreover, the design of the iPad Pro is too thin. After switching to an OLED panel, the extra space should have been used to double the battery capacity, aligning better with the productivity-focused positioning of the Pro product line. The Air line should be the one focused on being lightweight and thin."
I was literally dying when they showed a father recording their kid&#39;s birthday in the presentation. Imagine being a kid blowing out candles and your father is wearing digital ski goggles ffs apple 💀😭
"If you thought that phone addiction was bad, imagine how addictive this will be.<br>Edit: After they change the form factor to be more lightweight and portable."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSC0RkJuBVw&amp;t=499"">8:19</a> thats because of depth, the reason looking too close at a screen is bad is because your eyes are focused in 1 spot for long periods of time, however, vr headsets work because they feed 2 different images to each eye which simulates depth, this means your eyes can focus in and out and removes eye strain"
I don&#39;t think any tech in my life has gotten me this excited and this terrified at the same time.
"Correction - the first Apple TV remote was made of aluminium and glass, not plastic."
"Two additional tips:<br><br>1. With the current remote, clicking on the Right or Left arrows of the navigation ring will skip the content forward or backward.  The amount it moves depends on the app.  For instance, YouTubeTV skips 15 seconds with each click.<br><br>2. Changing the Keyboard Layout (Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Keyboard Layout) from Linear to Grid makes it MUCH easier to navigate the on-screen keyboard to enter text."
"Old Siri Remote is not made if plastic, it&#39;s actually glass, i know because my 3yr old smashed 4 of them"
"Nice little tip, but if you double tap the remote (no click) while the video progress bar is visible it will tell you what time it is and how late it will be when the video is complete."
"One feature you missed which is a must have for me is the Match Content option in the video settings. If that is on and your TV is compatible it streams video at the frame rate and resolution of the content, otherwise the Apple TV converts it to whatever your Apple TV is set to. <br><br>If you have a mix of content, for example movies at 24 frames a second, UK and North American TV shows which have different frame rates everything streams without annoying jitters, which can be really obvious on panning shots for example.<br><br>Many of the apps honour the setting too, so Netflix and Plex will match. The main exception is the YouTube app that resolutely converts everything to the overarching setting of the Apple TV."
One  function you missed.   The Apple tV can be used as an additional display from a  Mac.   It an also be used to mirror displays from your iPhone or iPad.
The timers over the stove was my favorite part. No joke.
that math notes is pretty sick ngl
iPhones suddenly looking like early 2000s mobile themes.
This man can even make a hotel room look cinematic.
how this guy manages to make a hotel room look like a professional set is beyond me
I am getting serious flashbacks to your April fools joke a while back. <br>6 years ago: <br>MKBHD - “Hey Bixby answer this math question”<br>Bixby - “Ok Google answer this math question”<br>2024:<br>MKBHD - “Hey Siri answer this question for me”<br>Siri - “Hey Chat GPT answer this question for me”
100% chance your wife or GF is in Bath and Body Works shopping for candles and foamy soap as you record this video.
"Have they fixed where Apple Music suddenly starts blaring a playlist when you start the car, without you commanding it to??"
"Oddly enough, my phone gave me a notification when you did the siren test, ha."
You have to sat &quot;tap {whatever}&quot; in order for it to click something with voice control
"Wouldn’t you turn silent mode on, if you don’t want notifications from multiple devices?"
It&#39;s wild how far car tech has come.  I now leave my phone and my keys in my pocket to drive.  The phone connects automatically and starts playing the last music I was listening to when I got out.  All of the car functions work with the fob in my pocket.  Took a while to get used to not digging out my phone and keys every time I get in the car.
"You didn&#39;t mention that you can use Automations with Carplay. That&#39;s VERY handy. I have an automation when I start Carplay to check the temperature. If the temperature is below 2 degrees celsius, I have SIRI say to me that I have to drive careful because it could be slippery. And you can do MANY more things with this..."
"Great tips, but here’s one I use all the time. <br><br>I ALWAYS listen to music while driving. I’m also almost always using Google Maps<br>or Apple Maps. My CarPlay screen is perhaps a bit smaller on my car, but if you tap the two squares in the lower left corner, you can see both your driving application as well as your music application, side-by-side, so I can skip songs while still getting all my driving information on one screen."
I would prefer a new iPhone Mini 😒
Who&#39;s asking for thinner? I want longer battery!!!!!!!!
"I want a thicker iPhone, with better battery life and a flush camera."
Slim on the phone need a thick wallet to purchase 😅
they&#39;re slimming it because they&#39;re about to fold it...
"I&#39;m not interested in a thinner device. I want more features, more battery, and more speed. It&#39;s thin enough."
"It’s weird that you guys make these 2 videos back to back, a folding iPhone and a slim iPhone, and never mention the obvious probability that they are most likely the same device"
"Camera’s need to be vertical for spatial video though, right???"
Thinner?! I want thicker. Easier to hold and more space for battery
"I don‘t care about the thickness, give us the Mini back instead"
"lets be honest , she doesn&#39;t know tech but knows only apple products🤣"
My girl didn&#39;t even check the new camera features of the s24 and the Ai😂
&quot;Performance test&quot; then goes on to open subway surfers 😂
I already knew before clicking into the video what she was gonna pick 😂
&quot;This is for science not for me!!&quot;<br><br>Moments later: &quot;just cause i think so.☝️🤓&quot;
"Girl did you forgot there is also a Samsung frig, a Samsung Microwave, a Samsung dishwasher, a Samsung air cleaner, a vacuum cleaner and a Samsung computer"
"I took my AppleTV 4k with me on vacation.  For some reason, when I connected to the TV at my VRBO I had to login to my streaming services. You said you believe you can boot it up and the services are still logged in.  Do you know why this would have happened?   Curious if I can do something different next time for a better result. Thanks!"
How do u activate all the signs with your hands in face time…or is it auto-activated?
Such a uesful tip. <br>1. fixed my Apple Remote with this technique.<br>2. Got the light sensitivity feature on now.
"This shop is at the Shopee mall for a few weeks now, kaso walang bumibili, sino ba naman bibili pag makikita mong ""0 sold"" diba? So I think these flash sales are to generate traction and to have initial sales sa product nila."
I just checked out today using my spay later iphone 13 0% interest for 12 months
Finger crossed I did reach out with shopee cs sabi nila legit store daw
Upon checking may isang review na.
Kaya yang mga 0 sold kasi kakabukas lang nyan ngayon (July 27)
"I don't think any store can just be labeled as ""Mall"" without getting verified by Shopee plus it's fulfilled by Shopee itself"
I think the store is legit
Kakabukas lang din ng store at wala pa atang isang linggo.
Pinost ni Christian Lim (Country Manager of Apple PH) sa Linkedin yan store sa Shopee.
"It's a legit store, [Shopee](https://www.facebook.com/100058161185380/posts/884310336850998/) even promoted them on their FB page."
Flagship store tapos authorized reseller? Pfft
I called Apple CS
"Got told that as long as the shop wasn't on their authorized resellers list (and this one isn't), I shouldn't treat it as legitimate"
"  I don't buy the whole ""Shopee CS said it's legit, so it must be! They even promoted it on their page!"" thing.."
There are so many fakes pretending to be authentic on Shopee and the platform doesn't even do shit about it (ex
  Just because a store is on shopee mall doesn't mean it's to be trusted
"I would be wary ordering from here until we have solid proof that they really are, as they claim, an authorized seller."
Walang COD sa shop na to
I still rather buy from TheLoop or BTB
Legit store yan
Fulfilled by Shopee means consignment yan ni Shopee from the main dealer here in the PH
"   Yung ""flash"" sale kuno na bagsak presyo yun ang may scammy tactic haha"
Nagsearch ako and meron din palang “apple flagship store” sa shopee singapore
Reviews are usually ilang months na lang ang remaining for warranty
So chances are they are selling it at low price bc those items were refurbished or 2nd hand
" Yun din siguro reason bakit listed ang items sa “others”, instead of brand new."
Looks new but legit naman
"If hindi, you can always not click on ""order received"" and ask for refund."
May fraudelent bang shopee mall?
Pag may 'fullfilled by shopee' sa akin automatic legit na
"Marami akong nakikitang fraudalent shopee malls, but never ""fulfilled by shopee"" products from shopee malls."
Is their gadgets new?
"Uyy bumili ako ng 13,  sana legit mygash,  naakit ako sa 0% interest"

"Just checked out iPhone 13 using my SPayLater, 0% interest for 12 months too! I decided to give it a day, checked the current reviews and its seems really legit."
Umorder ako ng Airpods Pro (2nd gen) last July 27 tapos dumating ngayon July 29
Medyo nakakatakot buksan kasi may hiwa yung labas na black bubble wrap pero makikita sa loob na naka box pa siya
"Nakaindicate naman na videohan para sure, kaya nirecord ko pag unbox ko"
"Mukhang okay naman yung box sa loob medyo yupi lang, nung binuksan ko na yung box, thankfully andun naman yung box ng airpods"
"Upon checking, medyo madumi lang yung box ng airpods, medyo iba lang hitsura niya compared sa airpods pro ko dati, may thai na language din siya sa box"
"Medyo hesitant pero pagbukas ko ng mismong box nung airpods, may laman naman sa loob"
"😌 Chineck ko agad yung serial number sa check coverage ng apple, nakalagay na airpods pro pero di pa maidentify kung kailan date of purchase para malaman kung hanggang kailan warranty"
"Pagkaconnect ko sa iphone nakalagay na hanggang May 2025 yung warranty, pero chineck ko ulit sa website at nilagay ko na today yung date kung kailan ko nareceive, then nagupdate siya na upto July 28, 2025 yung warranty niya"
Kabado pa rin pero sana magtagal kasi yung binili ko mismo sa apple official website nila ay umabot lang ng halos 11months nung masira sana ito tumagal naman.
"Hi! Share ko lang na umorder ako sa kanila ng iphone nitong July 28, nakuha ko na sya ngayon"
Nag-mamatch naman serial and IMEI ng unit and box
Bought my phone here and received it kahapon lang
so far so good naman :) I checked sa apple website mismo and under warranty siya until July 2025
 Also take note that the 0% installment fee for spaylater is until July 31 lang :) Nagnotify kasi si shopee and I guess promo din nila yun since kakaopen lang ng store
"So far upon checking din the reviews, almost 100+ na and 5 star rating lahat :)"
"Even if they do have legit apple products on hand, if you look around, people complained about the after sales of the apple flagship store in shopee SG"
It's likely this is a PH branch
"Nope, even 'shopee promoted' stores during sales can be fake, their screening is pretty bad tbh"
" Check the 3 reviews for that store, ALL THREE left feedback ON THE SAME DAY, the 27th, one account is banned, two are BOTH from 7 year old accounts that purchased the iphone 13 but the chances of random people receiving their item & deciding to leave feedback within a few hours of eachother, on a 50 day old store,  as the **only feedback for the shop** for the same item, are miniscule imo"
" Someone said Shopee are promoting them & apparently holding their products, here's the 'Shopee mall' requirements; [https://seller.shopee.ph/edu/article/18475](https://seller.shopee.ph/edu/article/18475) - According to requirements as an authorized distributor they;  Must have a strong physical presence in prime locations OR must have a dedicated website with e-commerce capabilities"
" Can anyone find proof of either?  Also take note, they have the **condition of the product listed as others,** which might explain why they are so cheap, used, returns, open box or factory refurbs, which isnt made clear in the listings, the product descriptions are pretty amateur"
 Personally I'd wait for more feedback to come in or at least proceed with extreme caution.
This is legit! I know someone from 🍊 app so tinanong ko muna kung legit talaga bago ako umorder ng IPhone 14 lol
"Ordered last Sat (July 27) and received it today, Monday (July 29)"
Dapat kahapon pa dadating kaso naubusan daw ng time yung rider lol
Btw I used Spaylater since 0% installment ☺️
I suggest buy directly to Apple Philippines Website! They are on sale right now plus freebie (either airpods or apple pen) if you are a student
U have peace of mind na legit sya
"E sa iba? Additionally, it was confirmed by Apple SG that it was not legit"
Check this out https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/13vai7n/terrible_experience_with_shopeemalls_apple_store/
I think it's not legit
May iPhone 11 at may iPad 9th gen pa...
"2 months old tapos 57% chat performance, pass"
"Scam, they post a discount so people will follow the store"
"Shopee promoted that store, so legit yan: [https://www.facebook.com/ShopeePH/posts/pfbid02qxCrEGSMhHZPEDaf1bUcNtyWCzH4GW71aHaipt7vznJKEKPCQkrdLya8Y3PuZKLCl](https://www.facebook.com/ShopeePH/posts/pfbid02qxCrEGSMhHZPEDaf1bUcNtyWCzH4GW71aHaipt7vznJKEKPCQkrdLya8Y3PuZKLCl)"
Apple Singapore confirmed it was not legit
Prob din yan ng singaporeans. https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/13vai7n/terrible_experience_with_shopeemalls_apple_store/
I checked out this morning as well! Can you post your convo with shopee? Just to be sure that it’s a legit store? :)
please add a review din if you receive it para others can tell its real XD
Replying for update haha
I also checked out using SPayLater for iPad 10th Gen
Hinintay ko rin talaga na may magreview (with picture) muna sa store bago ako nagdesisyon bumili kasi medyo sus din nung una at 31% lang yung Chat Response
 Kaya nagchat ako at nagreply naman ‘yong store - 1 year warranty naman
"Since 15 days return upon receiving it, I will observe it muna and papacheck ko rin sa technician kung may eme ba doon sa item"
  Chineck ko na rin yung LinkedIn post nung Country Manager of Apple Philippines na si Christian Lim - seems legit naman; cus why would he tarnish his name and reputation with 500+ connections?🧍🏻‍♀️  Reply ako ng updates once I received it
"hi, i also checked out an apple watch here just a while ago"
"""joined 7 weeks ago"" tsaka nakikita ko nang tagged  as ""shopee mall"" yan 2 weeks ago pa."
"May way ang mga scammers na makaasok sa shopee mall, sadly"
"Meanwhile, my small business with all the documents from BIR, IPOPHIL, DTI, etc"
was removed from shopee mall just because of the low number of followers and sales generated.
shopee express   ang magdedeliver mismo not  partnered logistics.
Un-tested returns with faults for example sounds like a possibility given the shopee SG Apple Flagship feedback from another comment.
Kinda suspicious
"Even me, I can make a fake account claiming to be Christian Lim"

But it's sound advice to wait for more feedback to come in or proceed with caution
" * The shop could have opened 50 days ago, processed their requirements in the meantime with no products listed, and eventually was able to list and sell their products much later"
I think they literally listed products just a few days ago
* The 3 ratings you see right now seem to come from legitimate people
"The one account that was banned was a banned shop, probably for not fulfilling BIR requirements"
The other rating was an account made 7 years ago yes and not much on that one but the name isnt a bot
* Exactly you listed that link as to reqs to be Shopee mall why would Shopee give them the platform to claim such things and make it to their FB page? Would Shopee be negligent to that large extent for a very large brand nonetheless? And with that line of thinking how does one prove the [Nintendo Official Shopee Store](https://shopee.ph/nintendoofficialstore) when there are no official and physical Nintendo stores in the PH? * You should actually look at the prices of their products they're selling that is not on the flash sale - it's realistic and comparable to other authorized sellers
It's normal even for other established sellers to entice people with flash sales with one or two units that are really cheap
Apple SG confirmed it was not legit [https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/13vai7n/terrible\_experience\_with\_shopeemalls\_apple\_store/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/13vai7n/terrible_experience_with_shopeemalls_apple_store/)
"Looks to be legit, shopeemall and it's even fulfilled by shopee, meaning, the items are in shopee's warehouse already."
It’s a legit store! Chatted sa shopee kasi nga skeptical rin ako
Hi I receive na yung phone seems legit need ko pa icheck ung item
May nagreview na sa iPhone 13 nila
I think legit nga talaga
Takot lang mga tao mag order bc of the “0 sold” hahahaha
Hi I receive na yung phone seems legit need ko pa icheck ung item Need ko thorough check
Hindi pa ko nag leave ng review sa orange app since hndi ko muna inorder received need ko muna to make sure.
Hi I receive na yung phone seems legit need ko pa icheck ung item Thoroughly
"And ngayon lang nag open OFFICIALLY, may na received pa nga akong notification sa Shopee app mismo kahapon eh."

"Triny ko icheck The Loop, yung ibang product condition din nila listed as 'others' (like yung Iphone 15 plus kung tama pagkakaalala ko)"
Still debating kung oorder ba ako from the Apple Flagship Store
"😅 I checked with Shopee CS, sabi nung support rep verified daw sila but I need more proof just to be sure"
"Yung seller mismo, hindi pa nagrespond regarding sa ibang queries ko."
I fully understand pero hindi naman rin siguro maveverify with workplace email yun linkedin nya if kakagawa lang and joined 2014 yun account sa Linkedin
"Btw I got the phone na rin, warranty is July 28, 2025, also check the serial number sa apple site, lumabas rin doon na July 28, 2025 yun warranty ko."
I cannot imagine why the official Shopee page would promote a scam like that
 Aside from the added requirements to be labeled as a Shopee Mall account
Shopee doesn't easily allow listing Apple products
"Even Greenhills sellers na may Shopee account cannot list ""Apple"" or other terms like iphone/ipad"
You have to manually visit their Shopee account and see their products
" Also other established Shopee accounts that are authorized to sell Apple products like Beyond The Box, The Loop, Digimap commonly do sales like that in monthly Shopee sales"
Then they put it back to their regular sale price after those listed products get sold.
It's already acknowledged as apple's flagship shopee store by the apple ph country manager
not a scam https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christian-lim-597a2188_dailymidnightdeals-activity-7222572157137043456-35R6?utm_source=screenshot_social_share&utm_medium=member_ios&utm_campaign=copy_link
Hayss
Country Manager but posted the announcement sa Linked In? Hmmm 🤔
"I don't really use cod, minsan lang pero ang weird for someone like you na nasa marketing field pero ganyan mag isip haha ganyan siguro personality mo noh? porket nag cod ang tao, yuck na? Di pwede diyan sila comportable at kampante? Entitled much ang unnecessary ng pa yuck mo"
"Money is money, doesn’t matter if cashless or not"
 Why do people even waste their energy for petty sh*t like this.
Ragebait: Trashy PH edition
Di ka ba mahal ng nanay mo haha
  **OR <-----------**   Must have a dedicated website with e-commerce capabilities
" The Nintendo shopee is an official seller, not a reseller, they have links to their shopee on the OFFICIAL website along with a dedicated e-commerce website, this is proof enough the shopee store is legit; [https://www.nintendo.com/ph/dealer/index.html](https://www.nintendo.com/ph/dealer/index.html)  The 'Apple Flagship Store' is a reseller with no online presence or physical location I can find proof of outside of this 50 day old shopee seller account"
" You can find 'Power Mac Center, Beyond the Box etc"
on Apple's seller locations for proof of physical presence; [https://locate.apple.com/ph/en/sales?pt=3&lat=14.43594741821289&lon=121.02429962158203&address=Philippines](https://locate.apple.com/ph/en/sales?pt=3&lat=14.43594741821289&lon=121.02429962158203&address=Philippines) - There is no 'Apple Flagship store
 I'm curious to see what kind of feedback pops up after seeing the 3 existing feedback were all left on the SAME day by one banned & two 7 year old accounts.
Even sa singapore may Apple Flagship Store and it was confirmed by Apple SG not legit
Prob din yan ng mga singaporeans https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/13vai7n/terrible_experience_with_shopeemalls_apple_store/
"If you dont mind, can you post your convo with shopee? :)"
Ok nmn ung imei codes under apple warranty kaso hindi ako nakapag request ng e-receipt upon checkout
Sealed po? How about warranty?
"Open na sya for a few weeks, ngayon lang nag pa promo."
"Easy, human error or corruption are my best guess"
THREE days prior they tried posting the same sale at [normal discount ranges](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/D9B2NuP2DHfcZjJA/) but I guess that wasnt enough to bait people
 Can you link any of the midnight sale posts showing extreme discounts from other stores? Last mention on Shopee's FB from Beyond The Box or The Loop are only regarding release of new products from years back
No super discounted sale posts

" The sale listings over a few days of 'midnight' sales are for 6 different items with discounts ranging from 10k to **70k.**  **\*Edit\*** Actually wait, I just found 'the loop'[ advertising the EXACT same midnight sale](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/JKP6VzVFAqTo7fUu/) in 24 hours except the pics are just taken from the apple flagship stores midnight sale & dont even match their pricing, this specific midnight sale is being spammed on FB with affiliate links to the 50 day old apple flagship store"
 [https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/dailymidnightdeal-](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/dailymidnightdeal-) If you want to take that as credibility then I guess we'll wait and see what happens
For me the item condition listed as 'others' is easy to miss for unaware buyers but will update this in a few weeks after seeing the feedback.
"Yep, seen the post in another comment, still a bit weird they listed all the items Condition as 'Others' instead of new"
Not that hard to select the right category
But at the very least it seems legit with the new user feedback coming in(nobody bothering to do testing of battery life etc)
Hopefully its not a repeat
Just read the comments here it was confirmed by Apple SG that it is not legit https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/13vai7n/terrible_experience_with_shopeemalls_apple_store/
Nareretrieve ba yun if naclose ko na session?
Naka usap ko ung technician na asawa ng pinsan ko nag matched ung code sa simcard slot at imei number
Upon check pasok parin sa warranty ng apple though wlang receipt na kasama so much better to request ng e receipt before checkout
"Upon checking sa apple website underwarranty, much better to request for e receipt before checkout kasi ang hirap mag request ng receipt after sales wla kasi kasama sa package na print receipt"
Bumili ako and makukuha ko na sya today
Post ako ng update kapag nasakin na haha

This sounds like an account from a paid troll minus the paid part LMAO.
"So you mean to say, na kapag cod ang mop, walang utak? Then paano yung may mga bad experience na sa cashless transactions kaya mas pinili na lang nila mag cod?   Well hindi naman ako magtataka kung mahal ka ng magulang mo, kase mukhang kelangan mo talaga ng matinding aruga"
😊
Kelan ang end ng warranty nya?
"No worries, just reported that loop page but still a coincidence if a fake page is also advertising the midnight sale involving the apple store in question"
Best to request for e receipt before checkout wla kasi kasama na receipt sa package and ang hirap mag request after sales ng receipt.
"Hi! Kakakuha ko lang haha sealed naman sya, warranty July 28, 2025"
Serial number and IMEI nagmamatch sa box and unit.
Ty po
Thanks! Tagal lang magreply ng customer support nung mismong store no
Ano pala inorder mo from them? Nacoconvince na din tuloy ako magcheck out
"Iphone 13 haha tapos yun box pala meron nakadikit na sticker na iridium technologies inc, nacurious ako kaya sinearch ko rin hahaha"
