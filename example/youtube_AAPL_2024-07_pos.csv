Apple&#39;s best self-parody ever.
Apple: Where yesterday‚Äôs technology meets tomorrow‚Äôs pricing.
Ngl the calculator on ipad was unexpected üòÇ
The ‚Äúbiggest upgrade ever‚Äù happens every year üòÇ
idk why the focus is on being thin. phones are fine at their current size I&#39;d like to see more power packed into them
"I am looking forward to September! However, I just upgraded to the iPhone 15 last September so I will wait another year or two for another upgrade. Hopefully Apple does figure out how to make a foldable iPhone that doesn‚Äôt have a visible crease. I am definitely ready more Innovation from Apple."
Taking off a VR headset reminds me of taking off ski boots. You appreciate being back to walking normal again but you really enjoyed the time on the hill.
"I‚Äôm excited to see our personas in a few years‚Ä¶ full body teleportation, sign me up"
I honestly just can&#39;t wait to see this in the next 5-10 years and see the market grow and competitors try to 1UP each other
"I don‚Äôt plan on buying this but I was curious about your review and appreciate so much how honest, realistic, and relatable you are. You are the best tech reviewer of the internet and I thank you for helping us understand the newest things coming to the market ‚ù§"
"&quot;Absolutely amazing, unparalleled, best I&#39;ve ever seen&quot; - quote going in Tim Cook&#39;s next keynote."
"As a housebound disabled person,  it&#39;s worth it because you are able to be excited and passionate about the world around you,  even if you can&#39;t walk anymore"
One of the best tech reviews ive ever seen. i wasn&#39;t bored a bit and half and hour passed like it was 10 to 12 minute. great video as always
Once agai√± I&#39;m watching a 40 minute long video about a product I&#39;ll never buy...and I enjoyed every second of it.
Definitely one of the most in-depth an informative reviews I have ever seen on anything whatsoever.  You so very clearly relayed the experience and nature of the Vision Pro.  I had absolutely no idea what this gadget was about since I&#39;ve had very limited exposure to VR but now I get it.  Thank you for the amazing walk-through.
"This is so cool, like it&#39;s absolutely not for me for so many reasons, but as someone that grew up with cassette players and CRT TVs, this is kind of mindblowing how far we&#39;ve come lol."
This man‚Äôs house/set is the environment in which Apple intends everyone to live and use their products.
"Took me a little longer to put this together than I expected, but as always, I hope it was worth the wait - I need to sleep now been up for 24 hours lol -  love you guys <br>Also thank you for 15 Million! ‚ô•  Btw I JUST finished testing out how good Apple&#39;s customer service actually IS - this will surprise you: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7iBFklVU_I"">https://youtu.be/Z7iBFklVU_I</a>"
"I&#39;m not familiar with your videos, but you definitely nailed it for Vision Pro! No sensationalism or clickbait, and excellent recap of the product."
So excited for the future
videos like these when you explain dynamically things about technologies are incredibly clear and fun to watch. thx
The way you managed to break down the steps Apple has used to prepare for this type of technology through years of models and devices in their past is amazing.
"great job, informative and amazing speed to get it out but top quality as always"
For me the integration with the AirPods is the best feature of all. They link flawlessly and the spatial audio is very nice.
"A vital setting to turn on is &#39;match content&#39; in the video and audio settings, turn that on for frame rate and HDR.  It then instructs the TV to alter frame rate and turn on/off HDR based on the content you are watching for smooth playback."
"This was excellent, Apple should pay you a ton of money to have this video installed on every box and made available from a new Getting Started tile which they should definitely add."
Excellent and informative introduction to the Apple TV 4K. A couple of things that I particularly like about this steaming box that you didn‚Äôt mention is the scrolling feature to quickly and accurately fast forward or reverse on many of the apps. <br><br>I also think the ability to switch quickly and easily between various different apps is another big benefit of the ATV4K box and provides much greater flexibility than using the built in apps on a smart tv or an Amazon fire stick for example where you have to completely exit one app before accessing another.
"So, you&#39;re telling me that I can ski on a dangerous mountain and watch my favourite movie at the same time??? AWESOME!"
It will be interesting to come back to this video in 10 years and see how far things have come.
The floating timers over the pots were really cool.
&quot;A solution in search of a problem&quot; perfectly describes this contraption.
This is giving me the vibes of early 2010s when new tech was arriving and people used to curiously test it  üòÇ
Not crying while cutting onions could be worth the price
The fact that joanna is funny and has a calm but entertaining actual personality is the main reason i stayed for the whole vid
I love putting my phone away and enjoying natural  life without phone while cooking and on family ski trips.
"Joanna‚Äôs humor and insight is always a standout against other reviewers. <br><br>Other people review the cut and dry of it, but wearing it while cooking or for 12+ hours? She‚Äôs crazy and I love her for it."
"They just named their AI, AI. Well played apple."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkYoBNdcXBU&amp;t=337"">5:37</a> love how he&#39;s reading all this information off his S23 phone"
"I love the fact that you&#39;re reading the patch notes from your S24U at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkYoBNdcXBU&amp;t=324"">5:24</a> ü§£"
"Not gonna lie, i‚Äôm surprised Apple finally folded and let us put our icons wherever we want"
open maps‚Ä¶<br>Open Maps‚Ä¶<br>OPEN MAPS!!!
The colour filter are also great if your wearing polarized sunglasses
I wish people did more videos on CarPlay. It&#39;s so nice to have. I hope for more wallpapers as well!!
I never knew you could change the wallpaper
"Hi, <br>Can you check if they&#39;ve added T9 dialling support to the Phone app in carplay as well, since they&#39;ve finally adopted it for iOS?<br>Seems like a truly helpful feature if you don&#39;t want to ask Siri and don&#39;t wish to doom scroll through a thousand pages to find the contact you want to call."
"One of the best tech presenters on the Web. The episodes are informative, comprehensive, delivered efficiently and his presentation style is never irritating."
"I‚Äôve been using Car Play for years and thought i knew all of what it did. Until I watched this episode. Once again you have helped. Your tutorials are alway educational, extremely easy to listen to and follow along with. There are others sharing their insights on YouTube and although filled with information, they are sometimes difficult to listen to for more than a few moments because of tone of voice or competitive antics. You are always on mark. Thanks once more."
"I‚Äôve written this before but thanks so much for being so clear, precise, knowledgeable‚Ä¶and all w such a patient and pleasant presentation üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª<br>Much appreciated üôèüèº"
"Apple Maps ETA feature in Carplay is fantastic - a feature few know about. For other Apple users, it sends them a temporary Find My Friends link, which is updated in real-time. And for non-apple users, it sends them a formal text with your ETA etc. If you are ahead or behind schedule, it updates them automatically! It even tells the other person when you arrive, so you don&#39;t have to remember."
Love your channel. Great video. One thing. You mentioned being able to change the order of your apps through settings on your phone bI was going crazy trying to figure out how to actually move them on that list n settings. I finally googled it. You have to touch and hold on the lines on the right of the app and move it to where you want it. Just in case anyone else is being as dense as I was being. üòÇ
Great video thank you. The only other thing I would‚Äôve mentioned it‚Äôs a little dongle devices that you can buy to make your CarPlay wireless. I have a 2017 Hyundai Tucson and I had to buy that in order to make mine wireless. Otherwise I had a wired CarPlay connection built in the device cost me about $90 and it works great.
"Your Apple-related tutorials are the BEST on YT, period! Everything is useful and it‚Äôs presented in a pleasant manner. TYSM!"
Never let a apple user do Samsung vs apple vids ever
samsung: gets 10 points<br>apple:gets 2<br>winner:apple
She admits samsung is a million times better but still likes apple and chooses apple over samsung cause its ApPlE<br>Apple is literally like a fashion trend at this point.
"I like Samsung a little more, the camera just looks more natural than Apple ‚Äî even tho, I‚Äôm an Apple user, the S24 Ultra looks better. Samsung takes the W!"
‚ÄúWhat did he say?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI said STOP!‚Äù <br><br>Haha great choice of clip and timing
I personally love the timer feature. When I feel sleepy while watching a show I‚Äôll put the timer on so that it turns everything off in case I‚Äôll fall asleep.
"I didn‚Äôt know most of these tricks, the PIP is an awesome trick"
"Thanks for explaining these features, that‚Äôs awesome!"
Thanks for sharing üòä
"A bunch of excellent points really appreciate this video. I do travel a lot and I even found a little case that holds my Apple TV, the cords and the remote, all nice and snug zipped up"
Great review!!!!!
"The Ordinary, Skinceuticals na maraming buyers and positive reviews)"
it's legit
Hi
"Apple Warranty is July 28, 2025."
It's good to be vigilant talaga and wait and see anecdotes from people
"UPDATE US PAG NA RECEIVE MO NA PLEASE, THANKS!!ü•π‚ù§Ô∏è"
Hope this helps.
can you let us know once you are able to receive the product? ü•π hopefully we are able to get legit products
"Thanks, this actually checks out, the only part I'd be weary of is the item condition listed as 'others', they should clear that up so buyers are fully aware incase the items aren't brand new"

A Country Manage will not just announced it on linked in
"Apple is a huge brand, sana nabalita yan na Philippines has an Official Online Store na here at nasa shopee"
Acknowledged as flagship by the Apple PH country manager
Prob din sya ng singaporeans
"I understand why'd you be wary but given how things have progressed, they're legit"
One account has made several ratings on a lot of products over the past 7 years
 ......Just give it a few more days and you'll see more reviews.....
and that's what you call promotional offers
Kindly pm me sis I‚Äôll send it
"Yes, that's my concern as well"
Kaya nag-chat ako doon sa store and they told me na bagong bukas lang daw yun store kaya may promo and all their gadgets are brand new
So let's see.
It's only one or two products they sell like that - it's just enough to entice people to wait for the sale
Nice! There's the solid proof we need then :)
Lmao
What matters is whether you have money or you don‚Äôt
Thanks for this! So hindi sya authentic Apple
Scary! A lot of people were deceived!!!
The 'Shopee mall' requirements for 'Market Presence' mention;  Must have a strong physical presence in prime locations
Hi! I checked out today as well

 Will be interesting to see how their customer support is for anyone that runs into issues after the SG stores poor feedback
The 31% response rate is concerning.

So happy for you at wala kang naging prob sa phone mo
