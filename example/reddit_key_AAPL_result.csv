1677,2024-06-11 03:09:28,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9981972575187684, An example is the iphone 15/plus not being supported and only the pro version is.

1680,2024-06-11 03:09:28,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9975525736808776,Perhaps a big issue with the 15 Pro pushback is because Apple have put the cart before the horse

1696,2024-06-11 03:09:28,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9992029070854188,"But if anything, they're most likely to take full advantage of AI processing on device, because if they don't it would be a huge breach of trust with user data considering how they've been one of the more consistent companies handling user data properly."
1697,2024-06-11 03:09:28,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9985710382461548,Apparently not because the user base is not yet on compatible phones

3128,2024-06-06 23:53:30,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9721711277961732,Not sure but I think the beginning of the song sampled “Century” by The Long Blondes (the part from 0:50 to 1:10)

3134,2024-06-06 23:53:30,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.936517596244812,She said recently on Marg.mp3’s  instagram that it was her attempt to write a song in the way Caroline Polachek writes and that it’s Caroline’s favorite song on Brat
3135,2024-06-06 23:53:30,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9946348667144777,"The end of the song reminds me of a song that’s lyrics are like “and everybody knows it, everybody knows it”? But I can NOT REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE SONG"
3136,2024-06-06 23:53:30,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9984610080718994,"Does this song have a sample?? It sounds so much like something I’ve heard before, I’m thinking of a song sung by a male voice maybe from the 80s or 90s?

3149,2024-06-06 23:53:30,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9979839324951172,I'm wondering if Charli took any inspiration from Lily Allen's song Apples
3150,2024-06-06 23:53:30,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.992473602294922,"It ends with Lily continually repeating the line ""I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree,"" which is almost exactly the same as the starting line of Apple, and obviously the title is almost the same"
3151,2024-06-06 23:53:30,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9997031092643738, I assumed it was just a coincidence since the songs don't bear any resemblance beyond this and Lily's album wasn't well-received
3152,2024-06-06 23:53:30,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.6329071521759033,"But then I saw Lily saying in a video that she attended Charli's show and was in the VIP section with Gabriette, Lorde, etc"
3153,2024-06-06 23:53:30,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9986181259155272,"- and Charli even commented, saying she was happy Lily came"
3154,2024-06-06 23:53:30,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9971643090248108,"If they're friends it seems relatively likely that Charli would have listened to the only album Lily has released in the last decade, in which case not a coincidence?"
3155,2024-06-06 23:53:30,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9970211386680604,"The structure of the song is a bit odd right? The viral verse should by all counts be the chorus, while the chorus is just “to the airport” repeated"
3156,2024-06-06 23:53:30,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9886759519577026,Who was the “genius” at Apple who thought it was a good idea to coat the iPhone in glass???

3163,2024-06-06 23:53:30,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9773040413856506,im thinking this song is inspired by can’t get you out of my head by kylie minogue!!

4870,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9995092153549194, There is just too many options
4871,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9997066855430604,And the “plus” is a bigger screen
4872,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9844659566879272, See for example the 8 and 8 plus was different the plus had more ram and optical zoom
4873,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.997295081615448,  Where today the plus and the base model is the same exact phone

4886,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9606235027313232,Otherwise I predict it’d become their best seller

4889,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9962518811225892,I am guessing the carrier pricing has some to do with it
4890,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9363248348236084,Ordered 4x iPhones this last week

4894,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9116525053977966,"I don’t see the point in upgrading significantly every year, as I recall the only reason I went from my XS to 13 Pro was because I wanted 5G and to be honest the macro mode is really useful for my business when I’m trying to get photos of model numbers or serial numbers and the like"
4895,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.98803049325943,  To be honest though I’ve not been tempted by the 14 or 15 pro so unless they do something spectacular this year I’ll keep my 13 pro and get a new battery put in it
4896,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9956263303756714, I saw the USB-C revolution coming though and protected myself of a sort by going MagSafe with the 13 pro
4897,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9995520710945128," Does sort of annoy me that the mini has gone though as my wife much prefers a smaller phone with the capabilities of the headline models, going to an SE now would feel like a downgrade for her truth be told, the chip is the same as the iPhone 13 in it and the rest of the phone is a massive downgrade, so I don’t know where that leaves people who like the smaller phones"

4902,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9910233020782472, I'm probably going to go back to the normal size model this year when the 16 comes out

4906,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9439070820808412,As he’s a big guy we figured the larger size would be friendlier for his hands as he’s still growing

4911,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.985452115535736,The Plus is just here to make you go   from “I want an iPhone so I’ll buy the base model which is cheaper”  To “for a bit more I get the plus which has bigger screen and better battery life so it’s worth it  To “but for a bit more I get the Pro which is better in every way
4912,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9985365867614746,Too damn many models
4913,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9956606030464172, Just make the $700 regular and a $1000 or $1100 model

4921,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9895954728126526,Also the fact that financing a device is usually on a two year cycle.

4930,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9933956265449524,The standard iPhone is priced in such a way that the Pro is far more appealing
4931,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9979698061943054,  No “pro motion” (120hz) on the standard model
4932,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9905306696891784,   Many iphone users consider their iPhone a status symbol and the standard model is the “peasant” model

4943,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.999880313873291,Extremely satisfying
4944,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9945600628852844,I bought the 15 plus just because it was pink  If it wasn’t for the color I would’ve gotten the pro max

4948,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9957948923110962,Honestly it’s not a terrible choice but the “plus” lineup has way less features for being more but only by half.
4949,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9994708895683287,For me personally it’s too much of a compromise considering the price difference

5051,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9997476935386658,  The 14 was when apple really honed in on making the base much worse than the pro by giving us the worst iPhone they've ever made.

5214,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.5922269225120544,Hard agree

5231,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.999794065952301,Not worth spending on a regular or plus
5232,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9968441724777222,Pro is what people should go for
5233,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.8804753422737122,"If they can't afford it, just get a pro from last year"

5236,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9994400143623352,"That is *awfully cheap* for an iPhone 14  I can’t imagine you trading in the 14 that you bought and put that towards a 15 Pro Max worked out without the service carrier screwing you, whether you see it right away or on bills down the road."
5237,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9592080116271972,My A14 chip iPad Air 4 has USB 3.0

5244,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9922816157341005,But he can only charge one at a time.
5245,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9996256828308104,The pro models are far too expensive to justify getting them over the plus phone.
5246,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9962388277053832,"I only notice 2 differences personally, it is the shutdown and startup noise it makes when you do those things, or the better flashlight( not by much but I’ve noticed it’s brighter than my dads iPhone.( I have a 14, he has a 13)"
5247,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9988351464271544,"More RAM for starters, the action mode when I record video, the better battery life irl, as my fiancée has a 13 and I had a 14"
5248,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9742029309272766,The 14 lasted long enough that it was a noticeable difference
5249,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.6424587965011597,"  Other than that, the more sustainable build approach, the crash detection, the overall slightly better camera are all worth $100 extra"

5253,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.98146790266037,"Most people don't care about that, but it's important to people who like to color grade their footage"
5254,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9733438491821288,"Lastly, the 14 has that SOS satellite thing"
5255,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9993477463722228,"For most people it doesn't matter, but what if you go hiking and get stuck in a ravine? You'll definitely be happy your phone has that feature."
5256,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9991222023963928,"Firstly, it's extremely difficult for me to ever dislike an iPhone in the first place; at worst, I may find something slightly annoying when upgrading to a new pro model but my overall experience with going from 13PM to a 1TB Deep Purple 14PM was:  * Size/weight increase became an extremely noticeable burden"
5257,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9871299862861632,"The camera bump made it elevate unreasonably high when sitting the phone on its back, to the point it would just wobble"
5258,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9954754710197448,The screen itself was superior but the phone's narrowness and heaviness genuinely was intolerable compared to the 13PM
5259,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9992369413375854,"Sure the two phones have a virtually identical body but these subtle differences are too noticeable and uncompromisable if you went from the previous model, imho"

5261,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9997518658638," iOS 16, along with iPhone 14 Pro series, should also be considered the worst iOS version"
5262,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9994787573814392,"It was appalling, and very clear the dynamic island was rushed"
5263,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9983332753181458,"The time I spent with it, my screen was either sideways, upside down, frozen, soft rebooting repeatedly"
5264,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.99963116645813,"The dynamic island was borderline useless at the time, the most interesting thing it did was floating to other sections of the screen"

5269,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9804301261901855, For me these were the major issues
5270,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9606115818023682,I know a lot of these persisted well after I sold mine because I saw constant reports about them
5271,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9937229752540588,Personally I just truly hope Apple learned to never release a phone with technology that was clearly barely out of beta (the dynamic island) and an OS that was mainly optimized for previous models running on it
5272,2024-03-03 03:22:14,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9892990589141846,"The 15PM is what it should have been, as the 13PM is to the 12PM but to a much larger extent"

11108,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9882290363311768,Does anyone notice when you are looking at your steps on the Apple Watch how when you hand around it ends up counting your steps I tend to move my hand around when I get excited because one day I was at 6173 steps and I got excited started moving my hand around then after I calm down I saw it was that 1193 steps so I can see that if you are really trying to keep track of your steps you could easily throw your step count out the window
11109,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.99987530708313,That’s very good to hear :) it feels very snappy and does everything I need it to

11129,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9786872267723083, A lot of it is marketing and the societal pressure to keep up with the Jones’

11132,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9997654557228088,I think the SE is perfectly fine for most people.

11136,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9993703961372375," Personally I *am* upgrading to the S9 from my SE1 primarily for the AOD, since I found that aspect of the SE annoying...but it's mostly because there's been a small windfall in the family, and I had been planning on getting my SE1's battery replaced anyway so it made more sense to put the money towards a proper upgrade that will last longer instead"
11137,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9944714307785034, Otherwise I'd have held on till end-of-life.
11138,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9992201328277588,"Actually, the SE may have better battery life than, for example, the Series 9, because there's no always on display"
11139,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9983295798301696,You could turn that off though
11140,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9078039526939392,But the Ultra will of course be much better regardless
11141,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9834132194519044,"Great choice with the SE, that's probably what I would get too if I was buying a new one."
11142,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.99498850107193,I can’t say for certain but Apple claims all day battery life for SE models as well as the series 9
11143,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9995985627174376,The only model they claim gets more battery is the Ultra
11144,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9933125376701356,But is it really worth double the price for that? It doesn’t take more than 20-30 mins to get enough charge for the day.

11146,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9952215552330016,the only downside of my watch is that it's battery is degraded a little bit even if it is new but okay

11149,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9466548562049866,yeah I was getting the same feeling

11151,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9059866070747375,For example I have an iPhone 13 and I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything
11152,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.998132050037384,I only felt that way on android not being able to use facetime etc
11153,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9997952580451964,"  It seems a bit bogus to spend money on the higher end models, because even if you would use the ECG and other more advanced health features, should you really be relying on an apple device to provide accurate information for that? I would think if you have some sort of serious illness, you would want something that is from a proper medical company"
11154,2023-11-30 01:52:46,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9949422478675842,I know the devices are pretty accurate relatively speaking but that's just my take.

12920,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.737471342086792,"  Something that a lot of people don't mention is that a watch like the Fenix or Forerunner series don't have a touch screen, which is incredibly useful when working out."

12927,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9972600936889648,You can also use Siri to turn AOD on or off so maybe in some scenarios where you need to see the time without lifting your wrist you can simply ask Siri to turn it on and then turn it back off when done.

12938,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9763122797012328,Also applies if you are an android user as the AW watch really kind of needs an iPhone to supply that extra usefulness
12939,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9973234534263612,"  If you would like to have a watch that is more customizable with different apps to do different things, the AW wins"
12940,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9960564374923706,However it needs to be charged nearly every night and thus sleep tracking is a bit of a pain

13015,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9946001768112184,There are two main issues with the watch IMO
13016,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.998538613319397,First the default workout app sucks
13017,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9992550015449524,"Second, the watch refuses to use the onboard GPS if the phone is in range"
13018,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9997454285621644,So a lot of people claim the AW has bad GPS when really it’s their phone that has bad GPS
13019,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.996510922908783,Just think of the variance in reviews when most people are really reviewing their phone

13022,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9997583031654358,If the reviewer doesn’t specify if they ran without the phone then you can basically throw out the review
13023,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9977856874465942,  I picked up an AW6LTE right after release and no way would I go back to my Garmin
13024,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9972278475761414,The key is to run without the phone (or turn off BT on the watch or phone first) and make sure to buy the WorkOutDoors app
13025,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9991292357444764,WorkOutDoors has TONS of metrics you can use and at the end of the run it will upload directly to Strava over cellular without any user interaction

13032,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.959177553653717, One other thing I forgot to add is the barometer actually works on my AW

13034,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9800114631652832,I could run a 10k out and back on the beach and at the end it would have me running down hill 250ft the whole time and no it wasn’t due to changing weather
13035,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9913184642791748,It did this regardless of weather or time of day

13037,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.999518632888794,Maybe the AW will also break but so far so good.
13038,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9965755343437196,The AW hatred in this sub is just bizarre and really weird
13039,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9744773507118224,It seems to be an emotional response by the haters

13047,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9883095026016236,Just a splash of Reddit’s hate boner for Apple with a dash of people taking their running so seriously they believe they need the in depth analytics a Garmin provides.
13048,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9992982149124146,"When you say music, do you need to have the cellular service to have any Apple iTunes playlists (from downloaded songs) work remotely?  I would assume no?"

13135,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9967502355575562,  So let’s do some math based on my results
13136,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9877346158027648,  (93-85)/28.5=0.28  So 0.28%/min
13137,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9972416162490844,Again the batteries don’t linier discharge so this is over simplified math
13138,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.99042409658432,But let’s assume it does discharge at roughly .28%/min
13139,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9902406930923462,  4 * 60 * .28=67.2  So a 4 hour run would consume roughly 67.2%

13239,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.999333918094635, It's a little inconvenient and sometimes it's hard to get both pressed at the same time at the end of a hard workout
13240,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9679779410362244," Also, sometimes I have to wait until I'm back at my house or car to dry my hands to end the workout, but it's already paused and I don't lose or mistime anything"
13241,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9979439377784728," Otherwise, the Apple Watch has been great for running"

13244,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9729271531105042,I’m curious though about the screen not holding up
13245,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9995802044868468,What extreme weather are you referring to and what does the screen do wrong?
13246,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9981877207756042,Yeah I used to feel the same why which is why it took me many years of lurking on the Apple Watch sub before I was willing to gamble with my money

13252,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9997172951698304,Disappointing? I mean it’s only meant for emergencies or short necessary calls
13253,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.998764157295227,It’s not a phone replacement

13265,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9905095100402832,So that'd extend the battery even further
13266,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9991337656974792, I think it'd do just fine for me.
13267,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9792094230651855,Last I read he has it working now and in the app

13269,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9978380799293518,So I’m thinking it will not be too far out
13270,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9769645929336548,I know he is also working on routes but personally Stryd integration would be a more meaningful feature over routes and that is coming from someone who doesn’t even own a Stryd meter.
13271,2021-02-25 02:49:38,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.998705267906189,I was still in the Garmin camp during the hack so I felt that pain

So the vast majority of watches sold in department stores and discount shops like Walmart or Primark that no way in hell last anywhere near 6 years before the base metal nickel coated Watch case wears out and promptly gets thrown out by 99% of the population isn’t a watch?

13882,2024-05-10 20:47:50,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.5564708113670349,I guess if you download something you can keep it forever even if Apple takes it down from the store

13892,2024-05-10 20:47:50,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9987123012542723,Just use the r/piracy wiki to find a mobile responsive ad free streaming site and install the web app
13893,2024-05-10 20:47:50,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.92523992061615,You can just visit a website on your phone and get pretty much the same experience as this app without needing to actually install anything
13894,2024-05-10 20:47:50,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9987643957138062,    Most websites allow you to cast straight from the player but if you want to download the movie aswell you can just get a file scraping app like 1DM instead.
13895,2024-05-10 20:47:50,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9981306195259094,I downloaded it too but there’s a review saying it’s gonna steal my bank info so I’m half debating on just deleting it now

13915,2024-05-10 20:47:50,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9987107515335084,They could have shown it to Apple before adding the patch with streaming features
13916,2024-05-10 20:47:50,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.998319923877716,the testing is manual and the flag gets set to off when in review to hide it
13917,2024-05-10 20:47:50,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9923670887947084,"really basic, there is nothing wow there"

13923,2024-05-10 20:47:50,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.93515282869339,Most likely yes if you use it without real-debrid.
13924,2024-05-10 20:47:50,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9997498393058776,Yeah but websites aren't hosted by apple/ apple store hence they have no reason to go after those or at least they have less power to go after those
13925,2024-05-10 20:47:50,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.998765230178833,This is the only way iOS users can get apps like these for now (until side loading gets introduced) and apple gets revenue from iTunes and stuff so they would not like apps like these on their stores.

14197,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9998182654380798,I still feel one of the best models Apple  ever released.
14198,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9981897473335266,I don’t understand how one got 7 years os upgrades and others got 6
14199,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9996532201766968,I have a (probably stupid) question if I got my iPhone 11 a few months ago how many updates do I realistically have before it is obsolete?
14200,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9959392547607422,(extra info for people who don't know) The 5c had the same CPU as the 5 (released 1 year prior in 2012)
14201,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9984972476959229,That phone lost support on iOS 10 (same as iPhone 5) while 5s (same year) got upto iOS 12 (because of A7 64bit chip)
14202,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9987572431564332, I think the 14 and 15 (non pro) WILL get updates because the technology isn't what it was 10 years ago
14203,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9986697435379028, Maybe even 1 year of extra updates  But they may cut support for the A15 and A16 at the same time for all phones (excluding iPads)
14204,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9766247868537904,So time will tell like you said

14206,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.902787446975708,I think they will support as long as the pro iphone
14207,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9994578957557678,"Nowaday the drop in OS support is usually because ""We can't support that many devices"" instead ""The hardware is not capable of running new update"""

14213,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9377638697624208,"If they stop updates, it will be like having an old phone that still works well and people may not feel the need to upgrade."
14214,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.999487280845642,I think that phones with the same chip will probably have support dropped at the same time
14215,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9871568083763124,Just look at the 5C with the same chip form iPhone 5

14259,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9995036125183104,Always unfortunate when the newer phones don't feel like an upgrade

14275,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.8569883108139038," I also don’t think they want to anger all of the iPhone XR fellas with a new upgrade, especially when they’ve just released a brand new device category in Vision Pro."
14276,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9852179884910583,You don’t have to upgrade just because it won’t be receiving anymore updates
14277,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.8247290849685669,I mean technically speaking your phone will still work as it does for a while as it'll keep getting security updates once it stops getting software updates
14278,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.998488187789917,Like assuming you're a average user you don't really have to worry about this
14279,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9950643181800842,Like yes you'll miss out on new features but unless new features is what you value a lot I wouldnt worry about this  I would only upgrade once the apps you use will require a newer iOS version and won't support older versions anymore
14280,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9927189350128174,Maybe not
14281,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.995821475982666,I’m hopeful it’ll get at least one more year.

14284,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9934678673744202,But that's only *if* your XS won't get iOS 18
14285,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9914451837539672,Time to upgrade buddy
14286,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9973958730697632,my advice as someone who held onto a iphone 6 for well past its expiration date and now also has an xs - turn off automatic updates for your apps
14287,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9983267188072203,new hardware permits so much software bloat that your apps will become unusable if you keep them too up to date

14290,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9376497864723206,"The 4s, on the other hand, is still quite snappy on iOS 7 though 8 and 9 quickly brought that thing onto oblivion."
14291,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9988781809806824,I kept mine on 6

14293,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9976671934127808,"I’m wondering about this too, I’m not sure when my phone will stop working but I hope it isn’t any time soon considering I can’t afford an upgrade."
14294,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9923349022865297,"i think it’ll definitely get 18, but i doubt it will get 19"
14295,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.841073215007782,It will follow the last years pro model 😉
14296,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9624812006950378,What do you mean the last time?  iPhone 6S and the six-months-later iPhone SE got 6 major updates
14297,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9894405007362366, You can't use the 5-series as an example
14298,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9973055124282836,iOS 11 did not support 32-bit apps and the iPhone 5S had the A7 which was the first 64-bit SoC.
14299,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9933524131774902,"It would make sense since the base models are now a generation behind the pros since the 13, which while it had an A15 like the pro, it had one less GPU core which did improve performance significantly over the 4 GPU core A15 on the base models."
14300,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9956969022750854,"i doubt it, like the iphone xr got the usual 6 years of updates, now the iphone 12 which came out two years later is twice as powerful"
14301,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9961112141609192," now the only reason the iphone 12 will get the same 6 years support is if the ios power requirement doubles in two years which is honestly very unrealistic, im sure that wont be the case"
14302,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.779950737953186, so the 12 has enough juice to get atleast a year more of updates if not two years more than xr
14303,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9973447918891908," so by that logic, the 14 should get 6 years support and pro will get 7?"
14304,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9613972306251526,Let's hope Samsung's promise to provide 7 years/versions of OS upgrades on their latest flagships prompts Apple to do the same
14305,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9986165761947632,"Apple has always been the  best when it came to supporting older phones with Os upgrades, they shouldn't let up now."

14307,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9997404217720032,"At the same time, it's also not exactly a very high bar since my previous device was a Samsung."

14311,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9996544122695924, I appreciate apple doing 5-6 years
14312,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.99971741437912,But forcing 7/8 years with the current hardware just seems ridiculous to me
14313,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9995187520980836,A 7/8 year old smartphone isn’t that useful besides for basic tasks

14315,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9989332556724548,But I don’t want apple spending tons of money trying to make new features work on obsolete hardware

14326,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9998682737350464,That's true
14327,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9943912625312804,"But one of the examples of features that came in newer devices but that could support older ones is a feature introduced in newer Macs that isn't supported on older ones but you can actually spoof the older Macs as newer ones and the feature works fine, I don't remember the feature though."
14328,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.6927213072776794,Yeah I still have an old X and it still runs smooth as ever (though I cracked the screen on my own) it’s only a problem when apps end support for your iOS version imo
14329,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.92600816488266,  Hopefully I can still get 2 more years out of my 11 though 😭

14340,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9992396831512452,This is why I don’t understand why people say the 14 sucks it’s just the same as the 13
14341,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9995647072792052,A similar Ram cut off exists between them.

14426,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.8309532999992371,The 13 and 13 mini are different phones
14427,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9992324113845824,Either they will cut the XS XR series cpu next or they will cut all 3gb Ram phones next
14428,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9880623817443848,Which will it be? 😈
14429,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9931787252426147,"Oh no, it seems even likely"
14430,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9998034834861756,I have to say that battery life is quite bad and multitasking is getting very bad
14431,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9995941519737244,So it might just let me down in the next months.
14432,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9980108141899108,The differences between a 13 and 14 are less drastic than that of a 6 and 6s
14433,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9890058040618896,"The 14 has 2 GB more RAM, but the 13 at least made do with 4 GB, whereas the 6s with 2 GB of RAM was doubling up over the 6's paltry 1 GB"
14434,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.994997262954712,"The A9 also had a massive performance bump over the A8, whereas the A15 on the 14 just has one more GPU core than the A15 on the 13"
14435,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.857408881187439, Not that the 14 is a bad phone – it's a better phone than the 13
14436,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9986947178840636,"But the 14 is a very iterative update, even for an iPhone, and it has a harder time justifying the $100 upcharge over the previous model compared to most iPhones"
14437,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9969526529312134,"If someone was buying an iPhone and they were looking at the 13/14/15's spec sheets, there's not a ton lost from saving $100 for the 13, and there's quite a bit more to be gained from ponying up for a 15."

14447,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9998087286949158,"Yes, pretty much"
14448,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.7664416432380676,"We will see how the current generations are handled, since the iPhone 15 has an older processor than the 15 Pro"
14449,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9938925504684448,"Maybe Apple does not want to drop the normal model before the Pro Model, but that is speculation."
14450,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9995973706245422,Yeah that is what I meant lol I was just rushing will edit comment to make it clear thank you

14452,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9994644522666932,It costs money to make the software compatible with hardware that a smaller percentage of the users are on with each new generation.
14453,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9987836480140686,"Yes, I know that"
14454,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.998960018157959,What I am saying is that 13 series and regular 14/plus will most likely have the same iOS version when it will stop receiving updates
14455,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.948971152305603,"Just like 5 and 5c, considering they both have the same chips"
14456,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9840535521507264,"Regular iPhone 15/plus and iPhone 14pro/max will also have the same version of iOS when it comes to their last update, considering the both have the same A16 chips"
14457,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.998789131641388, What I am looking forward is the regular iPhone 16
14458,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9981824159622192,Will it have the A17 Pro just like the 15 pro? Or a “new” regular A17 just without the Pro branding.
14459,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9995792508125304,i still have war flashbacks whenever i’m reminded how awful my iPhone 6 Plus performed especially for a flagship device at the time
14460,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9987021684646606,  the sudden shutdown issue and performance throttling even made its cry for help louder than i can bear
14461,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.998403251171112,>Why did not you just replace the battery?  Dad gave me a XS Max (along some other old tech) while he was replacing the TV shelf
14462,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9973233342170716,"I replaced the battery on mine in jan’23 (using since oct’2019) it still doesn’t last half a day updating apps takes away 5-10% easy and camera app, don’t get my talking about it"
14463,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.5695865750312805,Replacing a battery is worth it just for the first 3-6 months.
14464,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9501640796661376,Yeah based on this should be able to go all the way through 2027!
14465,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9149305820465088,There is a project to revive it  Not sure when it's ready but it will hopefully come soon  But then again I didn't realise it was the original iPhone so let's hope it supports under iOS 6
14466,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.995376467704773,I can't speak for the other person
14467,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.997675359249115,"But for me, it would be a sidegrade if not a downgrade because they're bigger phones."

14469,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9994625449180604,Yes its nice to have but its not really something ill gag and be drooling about because its not something that really changes the iPhone experience and if you tell this to someone who doesn't care for tech they will look at you like you're crazy
14470,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,NEGATIVE,0.9843106269836426,"Before you say I have to to back to my 12, yes I have and I can absolutely tell a difference and I see the choppyness  but the thing is, you can easily force yourself to get used to 60hz again and once you do its really not a big deal as you people really make it seem like"
14471,2024-02-03 23:38:40,AAPL,POSITIVE,0.9993048906326294,just give it like 15 mins max and you'll be good again using a 60hz iPhone again
